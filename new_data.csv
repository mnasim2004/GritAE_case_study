Investing in success: How Fundrise resolves 50% of its support volume with Intercom’s Fin,"We spoke with Luke Ruth, Chief Product Officer at online investment platform Fundrise, about the challenges of supporting a growing customer base without the right technology, and striking the right balance between personal, human support and AI-powered efficiency.
Fundrise is the largest direct-to-investor platform and allows individuals to access alternative assets like real estate, venture capital, and private credit. Fundrise has over 2 million users, ~$3 billion of equity capital under management, and generates over a million tax documents each year.
Having experienced limitations with, as Luke puts it, a “standard toolbox” for support, the Fundrise team set out on a journey to implement Intercom’s complete AI-powered platform – a decision that continues to pay dividends.
Let’s dive in. Can you tell us about your customer communications setup before Intercom, and what challenges you faced?
Historically, we’ve used the standard toolbox of email and phone support (no chat) to connect both prospective and existing investors directly with our Investor Relations team for any type of question. The questions we get range from being incredibly high-level, like “What is Fundrise?,” to the typical support requests around password resets, to complex questions around our investment strategy and property underwriting.
As you can imagine, solving some of those questions, like the more complex and nuanced ones, was time well spent. But solving some of the more frequently asked or basic questions, like 2FA issues or questions about account statements, was a pure time suck.
The core challenge was responding to all cases in a timely manner while carving out sufficient resources for our team to spend on providing thoughtful answers to the questions that warranted them. What did you need to solve those challenges?
We needed to be able to take the less complex cases off our Investor Relations team’s plate. If we didn’t reduce the load coming from those types of cases, we were going to be stuck choosing amongst a number of bad options, like:
Get back to people slower
Reduce the quality of responses
Hire to scale the team in an unsustainable fashion
We engaged Intercom specifically to use its AI Agent Fin as a way of handling those low-complexity cases. All of the answers to our frequently asked questions already existed in our site and app, but people just weren’t finding them. We saw Fin as a great opportunity to serve up our content in a way that was more easily accessible to our customers.
We conducted a proof of concept where we quickly trained Fin on our existing help center content, investor updates, and marketing site, and ran a series of tests in quick succession where we exposed Fin to a larger and larger audience. Being able to monitor the success metrics as we rolled Fin out to bigger and more important audiences gave us the confidence we needed to execute quickly. It also helped to ensure that the answers being provided were right and actually making for a better customer experience – not just taking the load off our team internally. What results have you seen since you implemented Intercom? Any hard metrics you can share?
The results have been extraordinary and exceeded our expectations by a considerable margin. Less than three months after launching Fin, it now handles more than 50% of our total support cases.
We typically see a considerable spike in interactions at the beginning of the year as a function of seasonality and taxes, and while we did see that same spike, Fin was able to field almost the entirety of the spike, yielding a nearly 50% reduction in cases year-over-year. Fin has had a huge influence on our hiring roadmap for the Investor Relations team, allowing us to be much more selective about how and when we grow the team, as opposed to having our hand forced by a high volume of cases. What do you think is the biggest benefit of Intercom?
First and foremost is the ability to handle low-complexity support cases. But beyond that… the ability for non-technical team members (non-engineers) to be able to manage and improve on the experience over time.
Since launching, our Product and Investor Relations teams have worked together to take the accuracy of Fin’s responses from 80% to north of 95% – with zero technical resources required. That’s an incredible unlock. What advice would you give to others considering using Intercom?
Use Fin."
From complexity to clarity: Retention.com’s journey to consolidated customer service,"In today’s world, customer satisfaction is make or break for any company. Customers expect next-level experiences when seeking support – and they’re not willing to wait around for anything less.
A company all too familiar with the importance of keeping customers happy (and around) is Retention.com, a platform with product offerings to help Shopify merchants recover lost shoppers and increase revenue, identify anonymous website visitors, and expand businesses’ email lists.
Having previously experienced challenges with a fragmented customer service tech stack, Retention.com wanted to consolidate its support tools and workflows into a single platform. The team already used Intercom for support ticketing – with great success – so it was the obvious choice to help them unify the rest of their support ecosystem. Identifying the problem-to-be-solved
Before using Intercom to power the entire customer service experience, Retention.com used separate tools to house its knowledge base and manage support tickets. This resulted in a disconnected – and at times, frustrating – experience for customers, so the need for a more streamlined, efficient, and user-friendly support solution became increasingly apparent.
“We’d been using Intercom for support ticketing for years, and with great success, but our support documentation was housed in a makeshift blog on our marketing website,” says Robb Clarke, Technical Operations Manager at Retention.com. “It was hard to navigate, and difficult to find the article that you wanted because of limited search functionality and no real ability to suggest related articles. Ultimately, it wasn’t the best experience for our customers, and if they were seeking support in the first place, having a bad experience while trying to solve a problem wasn’t going to help the situation.” The path to a unified support experience
Determined to tackle these challenges and create a more consistent customer experience, the team turned to Intercom. “It made sense for us to leverage Intercom’s Articles feature for our knowledge base since we were already using the platform for ticketing,” says Robb. “We knew this would enable our agents to easily reference articles in their replies to customers, as well as a ton of other conveniences from having everything in one place.”
However, with close to 200 blog posts already written on Retention’s makeshift blog hosted on WordPress, Robb and his team initially felt that this would be a big mountain to climb. Luckily, the team was able to use Intercom’s API to help them do this with ease. “By exporting our articles and using the API, we managed to efficiently migrate and categorize our content in Intercom – formatting and images included,” Robb says. “This beat manually porting almost 200 articles.” The power of AI and automation
Since moving support to a single, consolidated customer service platform, Retention.com has hit the ground running. “Honestly, we loved Intercom so much that we even got a second instance of it just for our B2B product, RB2B,” says Robb.
The team is focused on empowering customers to self-serve answers to their own questions, so they leaned on Intercom’s AI and automation to help them move the needle. “The biggest win for us is the ability to see how well our users are able to serve themselves when it comes to their support needs. In the last seven days, we’ve had 1,726 instances of users seeking support. Of those, 96.2% were resolved through self-serve support,” says Robb. “So they were able to resolve their queries using our knowledge base, workflows, or Intercom’s AI-powered chatbot, Fin.” With AI and automation tackling the bulk of Retention.com’s support volume, Robb explains that the team is freed up to focus on other areas of impact for the business. “Only 1.7% of our support instances in the last week were handled by a human from the start, and 2.1% were helped by a teammate after self-serve, for a total of 3.8% needing human involvement overall. Fin alone is resolving 34.7% of the conversations it’s involved in, so being able to drastically reduce the need for human interaction on our end allows our team to continue to improve the product, expand our documentation, and improve our support offering.” Help before it’s needed
In addition to the wins the team has experienced on the self-serve front, Robb points to Intercom’s proactive support functionality as being “a wonder, as well.” The team uses Workflows to trigger proactive messages as users interact with specific pages in Retention.com’s dashboard, enabling them to personalize customer communication, provide help before it’s needed, and create stand-out experiences.
“Intercom’s proactive support capabilities give us the ability to automate communications when users meet certain criteria, whether it’s of a customer care nature, like touching base if they haven’t installed our script after a certain amount of time, or sending an email to celebrate quick wins, like reaching a particular account milestone,” says Robb. “They’ve been really effective for us so far – of the customers who have interacted with our workflows, 38% have completed them. And if a customer has a more complex question or wants to talk to a human, the fact that we've already collected answers to a lot of fact-finding questions via the workflow greatly reduces the time it takes us to process a ticket."""
Soaring satisfaction: Birdie Care’s support automation success,"In the fast-paced world of customer support, where quick responses and resolutions are crucial, the arrival of AI has been nothing short of revolutionary. Among the champions leading the charge in AI-driven customer support, Birdie Care stands out.
In an age where 9% of the world's population is over the age of 65, the demand for efficient and compassionate elderly care has never been greater. Birdie Care, a holistic care platform providing tailored preventive care for older adults, recognized this early on.
With an aim of radically redefining how we age, Birdie partners with homecare agencies and equips them with state-of-the-art software. As Luke Cullimore, Revenue Operations Manager at Birdie and a key figure in their support operations, “Our mission is to radically improve the lives of older adults and ensure that we can all age safely in our own homes.”
Here's the inspiring journey of Birdie Care’s partnership with Intercom, when AI met empathetic customer support. The challenge: Meeting the needs of a modern care system
As Birdie expanded, the challenge of delivering consistent and high-quality support to its partners grew enormously. The support team – which had grown to include 12 support associates, several managers, and a head of support – still struggled to efficiently handle incoming requests and faced large training gaps within the team. “We've pretty much doubled the scope of our platform and product over the last 18 months,” Luke shares. “And with that came so many new complexities and queries.”
Having initially implemented Intercom five years ago, Birdie temporarily transitioned to Zendesk, hoping it would address the team’s enterprise-grade ticketing system needs. However, without a thorough request for proposal (RFP) process, and after a hasty migration, they faced implementation gaps and functional limitations.
The team found themselves at a crossroads. The solution: A return to innovation with Intercom
Realizing the gaps in its new solution, Birdie quickly turned its attention back to Intercom. As Luke candidly shares, “We had a brief period where we looked at Zendesk and actually started trying to implement it. Within a week, we pivoted back.” Birdie found unmatched value in Intercom, viewing it as their “full-stack support solution, for now and the future.” Luke adds, “The product innovation and vision Intercom shows is creating a new category in support.”
Intercom‘s full-stack solution offered Birdie a consolidated tool that addressed both customer communication and support.
The introduction of Fin, Intercom‘s AI chatbot, was a game-changer for the team. Fin became Birdie‘s primary solution for automated support and bot-based resolution, offering an immediate and effective solution to the rising tide of customer queries.
The Birdie team now confidently serves a rapidly growing customer base and is excited about Intercom’s continuous advancements in ticketing and support. They believe that these developments not only drive operational efficiency when it comes to managing simple queries, but also enable the team to tackle complex queries in a more effective and efficient way.
Since integrating Fin, Birdie has witnessed a remarkable improvement to its support efficiency. “Fin is now resolving 26% of our conversations, a significant improvement from our previous benchmarks,” says Luke. Key results
A 2pp increase in CSAT scores in August and September, sustaining a score of over 90% for more than a year.
26% Fin resolution rate, for conversations it was involved in.
A 20pp increase in auto-resolution rates within just two months.
These results weren‘t just numbers – they were a testament to a well-thought-out approach that prioritized user privacy while leveraging technology‘s power.
Birdie has since taken actions to revise its capacity forecast and business plan – and even reduced the expected headcount the team would need to meet increasing demand for the year ahead by 30% thanks to the efficiency gains of AI and automation. Additionally, the team saw huge improvements in support’s contribution to the company’s gross margin. Overcoming obstacles to success
As a dynamic healthtech company, diving into the realm of AI-powered support solutions presented both an opportunity and a challenge for Birdie. The team had to tread carefully around data privacy, especially with solutions hosted outside their primary region. Initial apprehensions rose around the risk of sharing personal data with Fin.
Luke vividly remembers the launch of Intercom‘s AI-powered chatbot, Fin. “When I first saw the releases about Fin, I was all over Slack, pinging my team – especially the data protection officer and CTO. There was this buzz about what Fin could possibly do,” he says.
But for Birdie, the path wasn‘t straightforward. Initial reactions were mixed. As one teammate put it at the time, “The reality is we can‘t be early adopters here because of the privacy risks.”
Concerns about user privacy were paramount given that customers could freely share personal data in the chat. “We had to be certain,” Luke says. “What if a user unknowingly shares their personal information? And would Fin genuinely be effective for our complex product?”
However, Luke saw an opportunity to assess the true risk and the genuine value of the tool. He invested time in manually running 500 historical customer queries through Fin. The results were revealing:
Personal data was rarely shared in chats.
OpenAI and Intercom‘s partnership ensured there was zero data retention on all Fin conversations.
The team was able to estimate the expected auto-resolution rate they would see with Fin.
With these insights, the Birdie team trialed Fin with 100 partners. Because of their focus on privacy, they always asked customers upfront whether they intended to share personal data. After the initial release in Q3, the team spent Q4 re-reviewing their privacy concerns, identifying their most low-risk queries, and increasing the scope of Fin – boosting auto-resolution rates to 22% as a result.
Based on this success, Birdie expanded its usage of Fin, achieving consistent, positive results as Luke explains: “We're seeing the same results with all of our partners now as well. And there was an uptick in CSAT ... we've maintained like 90% CSAT for the last 12 months.”
This rigorous and systematic approach ensured not only internal acceptance but also the protection of users‘ sensitive information. Embracing ‘human + AI’ approach to support
Tech is transformative, but the human touch is at the heart of support. Amidst the advancements in AI, Birdie‘s support team was eager to understand their evolving role.
The goal was clear: AI was there to augment, not replace.
The team was focused on ensuring AI‘s decisions resonated with the human ethos of care that Birdie stands for. They took a strategic approach to enhancing the support experience with AI and automation, focusing on a number of key areas:
Manual checks: Birdie still manually checks conversations where Fin interacted to gauge the accuracy of the responses. Using Fin conversations in the Inbox – a navigable and filterable list of all of Fin’s conversations – the team samples chats where Fin was unable to provide answers to understand gaps in their support content.
Feedback loop: Since hiring a dedicated support content manager a year ago, Birdie has doubled its help center‘s size and scope. Through Fin, the team can now instantly gauge the effectiveness of changes made to the help center. Luke emphasizes the valuable feedback loop Fin provides, saying, “The feedback loop for Fin is probably the most optimal feedback loop we've got around our help center.”
Content targeting: Luke highlights the team’s ability to tailor content shown to users based on certain customer attributes. This tailoring helps streamline customer support and enables Birdie to offer personalized help to specific users.
Future focus: Moving forward, besides refining their use of AI, Birdie plans to further delve into ticketing systems and to consolidate their tiered support model to ensure their growing customer base gets optimal support. Building for the future with Intercom
Birdie‘s ambitions are high. As the team continues to see momentum in their go-to-market motion, they have outlined a three-point plan:
Operationalize Fin to continuously improve resolution rates.
Holistically integrate Intercom Tickets across support workflows, tapping into new SLA functionalities.
Build premium service channels like phone and screen share, transforming support into a revenue-generating function.
Inspired by brands like Monzo, which is known for its exceptional support experience, the Birdie team envisions a future where their support isn't just efficient, but a true hallmark of excellence.
With Intercom‘s innovative solutions, Birdie has been able to enhance its support strategy and empower its team to embrace the future of tech. Birdie‘s journey with Intercom epitomizes how forward-thinking companies can harness technology to not just solve immediate challenges but also pave the way for future innovations. Through this partnership, Birdie stands poised to lead in an age where quality elderly care, backed by robust support, becomes the norm, rather than the exception."
Doubling down on customer satisfaction: How Mebit transformed its support experience with Intercom,"Mebit is a company that provides critical services like customer support, VIP hosting, “know your customer” (KYC), and compliance to the largest online casino, Stake.com.
The team’s journey with Intercom started back in 2017 when they decided to uplevel their support experience and make it faster and more efficient. Having grappled with a clunky, email-only communication setup, Milan Jovancevic, Mebit’s Director of Operations, says, “It was super messy. We needed something that would enable us to reach out to customers faster than email.”
The hunt for a better support solution led them to Intercom, which, according to Milan, stood out as the only viable choice for chat-based support at the time – and remains so even today. “I fell in love with the Intercom Inbox and how well it was organized,” says Milan. “The interface was super clean compared to our previous platform.”
But the big game-changer for Mebit was Intercom's Messenger. “When we started using chat to support our customers, our first response time dropped to under 10 seconds,” Milan highlights. These faster responses also resulted in quicker resolutions, with the median time to close a ticket plummeting from two hours to just seven minutes. “We’re now solving tickets in just a matter of minutes, compared to the hours or days it was taking us to solve them via email,” he says. However, it wasn’t just about speed. Intercom brought a level of organization that unlocked new opportunities for Mebit to delight both its support team and customers. Features like user attributes, auto-assignment, and team inboxes allowed Mebit to tailor the customer service experience and sort conversations more efficiently.
“Intercom made things easy for our customers, and easy for our team to help them,” says Milan, adding that Intercom’s Help Center Articles feature alone led to a 20% reduction in the number of tickets the team received. The results Mebit has seen since upgrading its support setup have been nothing short of extraordinary. “Our performance has jumped significantly since we started using Intercom. Previously, each of our agents could handle a couple of emails at a time. Now, they can handle 10 conversations simultaneously,” says Milan. “That’s a huge jump and means we can help much more customers – faster.”
Intercom is now an integral part of Mebit’s support tech stack. The team has linked the platform to their social media accounts, as well as other core tools such as Evaluagent and Jira, ensuring that all the systems they need to provide standout support are seamlessly connected. Reflecting on the journey with Intercom so far, Milan shares, “The biggest benefit of Intercom is that it has everything you need to create a great experience for your customers and your support team. Literally, anything you need, you can find in the platform. My advice to anyone considering Intercom is to just do it. You won’t regret it.”"
A conversation with Bailey Nelson: Leveling up customer service with AI and automation,"We spoke with Jackson Rostagno, Customer Service Manager for Australia and New Zealand at Bailey Nelson, about the team’s experience switching from their previous support tool to Intercom, and how Intercom’s focus on AI, automation, and conversational support has enabled them to solve the challenges they were facing and produce stellar results across their support. Please tell us a bit about your company and your role(s) there. 
Bailey Nelson is a fashion-forward optical retailer that was born in Bondi, Australia. We devote ourselves to bringing joy to eye care so our customers can continue seeing life in the best possible way. 
By removing exorbitant price tags, blah service, and compromised options, we’ve been able to bring the joy back to eye care and flip the tired “I HAVE TO” situation into a joyful “I GET TO” moment. 
I lead our Customer Service team in Australia and New Zealand. Our job is to respond to all incoming communications through a range of channels, and we also coordinate with our store teams and external suppliers to ensure a seamless customer experience.  Can you tell us about your customer service setup before Intercom, and what challenges you faced? 
Before we switched to Intercom, we were using another company for our customer communications, but we had a lot of ideas on how we wanted to level up our customer service. The way we were handling support just didn't match up with what our customers expected, especially given that we have a young customer base. Nowadays, people expect to use modern technology to get quick and effective help. We knew we needed to make improvements, especially with the emerging changes in automation and AI in today's world. 
You could say our main problem was usability, both for customers messaging us and for our team managing the conversations on the back end. We needed easy workflows and automations to make sure the right issues reached the right people quickly – and let's not forget gathering enough information from customers outside of our team's working hours. We wanted to solve problems with just one response, not go back and forth for details. 
My team used to be swamped with tickets all day, every day, leaving hardly any time for other tasks. The backlog of 100-200 unresolved tickets was overwhelming, and it definitely stressed out the team. Intercom allowed us to scale in a way that we were able to clear this backlog within a month. This provided us the time to complete other pressing tasks in a timely manner. What did you need to solve your customer service challenges? 
We needed a solution that could address our main issues, which included long response times, inefficient processes, and a lack of comprehensive, real-time reporting on metrics like customer satisfaction. So, we went on the hunt for a platform that could improve usability, speed up response times, and take advantage of automation and AI to enhance our overall experience through self-serve, proactive, and instant support.  Can you please describe how you have implemented and used Intercom to solve your customer service challenges? 
We installed the Intercom Messenger on our site, which quickly streamlined communication for customers, and the Inbox made it easy for our team to engage in conversations with them. 
We improved our processes using Intercom’s automation and AI capabilities, which helped us gather customer information faster and cut down on response times. Using efficient and customized workflows, we were able to customize our workspace for our agents to cut down on repetitive tasks throughout the day. The Articles feature allowed us to provide self-service support through our help center, ensuring that customers could find answers quickly, straight from the Messenger. We also connected our social media accounts to Intercom to handle those inquiries promptly. 
Overall, Intercom's approach to conversational support, automation, and AI has been integral in solving our customer service challenges. How did you find the migration process when switching from your previous support tool to Intercom? 
The migration process was simple and straightforward, with an amazing amount of resources and videos to help. We decided not to take all of our data across. The things we did take across – the help center articles and our conversation history to feed Custom Answers for Fin – both had dedicated API integrations to make this easy and quick. I also found that training the team to use Intercom was very straightforward. The platform is very intuitive and the Intercom Academy has a bunch of helpful walk-through videos to get the team familiar with the platform. All in all, a very smooth process.  What are the key elements service leaders should be aware of when conducting a migration from your previous provider to Intercom?
I think the main thing that teams initially need to get their heads around is the slightly different philosophy that Intercom has. Intercom has conversations and tickets, where conversations are for quick and seamless interactions, and tickets are for more complex cases where the time to solve might be a few days or the case might involve several different parties.
One other thing that should be considered is having a dedicated representative in the company that is responsible for keeping updated on the exciting changes that happen, and delivering this information to the wider team. Intercom is in a continual process of testing and releasing new and exciting features that allow you to be at the forefront of customer service and be able to integrate the latest technology advances into your workspace, allowing you to improve your customer interactions and processes to deliver the best possible service. What metrics improvements have you seen across support and marketing since you implemented Intercom? 
Since implementing Intercom, we've seen substantial improvements in our support metrics. Our first response time decreased from several days to under three hours – a 96% reduction. We also cut down the time it takes to resolve issues from three or four days to about four and a half hours, on average. Our customer satisfaction scores started out at around 75% when we first made the switch, and have now risen to between 90% and 95%, on average, each week. We also noticed more people using self-support articles and getting answers from our Custom Answers feature, solving about 11-12% of their issues on their own. These metrics demonstrate how effective Intercom has been in enhancing our support and increasing customer satisfaction. How does Intercom fit into the rest of your tech stack? What tools have you connected to Intercom? 
We've been able to connect Intercom to our Shopify store and are planning to integrate it into our in-house point of sale system. This will help us improve how we handle internal escalations and enhance the overall customer experience from both an in-store and online perspective. We have been able to also connect Intercom to our Slack Workspace to get quick, customized notifications in specific channels, based on the incoming communication. What do you think is the biggest benefit of Intercom? 
For us, the best thing about Intercom is how it seamlessly blends automation, AI, and a conversational approach to customer support. This combination allows us to respond to customers faster and more efficiently, while also empowering them to find solutions through self-serve support. The user-friendly interface is a big plus, too, as we can make changes and improvements without needing a coding expert. Plus, the fact that Intercom keeps innovating means we always have access to the latest tools to level up our support. How does using Intercom make you and your team feel? 
Using Intercom has really boosted our team's morale and effectiveness. Before, we were drowning in tickets and struggling with slow response times. Now, with Intercom's automation, we're managing conversations way better and providing quicker resolutions. It's reduced stress and increased team satisfaction. The platform's simplicity also lets us implement changes and improvements smoothly. All in all, Intercom has empowered us to be more proactive and confident in delivering top-notch customer support.  Are there any opportunities you’re excited to unlock with Intercom in the future? 
We're looking forward to exploring more possibilities with Intercom and utilizing features such as Fin and Tickets, as well as using the platform for other internal use cases. We also plan on integrating it with our in-store point of sale system for better customer service. There's a lot we can tap into in the near future! What would you say to customer service leaders considering making the switch to Intercom? 
There are probably many people who aren’t satisfied with their current solution and believe it could be improved. They might start with the intention of innovating but end up replicating old ways when they switch platforms. It's important to break away from that. 
Change can be tough. And if you have a big team using the platform, there's more pressure to make sure everyone is on board and comfortable with the switch. So make sure you think about managing expectations and how to get everyone aligned."
Fresh Technology's journey to first-class support,"We spoke with Jonathan Kilton, Director of Revenue Operations at Fresh Technology, LLC., about their transformative journey with Intercom. Get ready to dive into a story of improved efficiency, elevated customer support, and the tangible impact of transparency across the customer service organization. Can you tell us a bit about Fresh Technology and your role?
Certainly! My name is Jonathan Kilton, and I’m the Director of Revenue Operations at Fresh Technology, LLC. Fresh Technology is a SaaS provider specializing in restaurant technology solutions. We offer a suite of products designed to streamline various aspects of restaurant operations, including back-of-house, front-of-house, and out-of-house solutions. My role involves overseeing revenue operations and ensuring that our technology helps restaurants enhance their presence, reputation, and profitability. Our systems manage over $300 million in annual sales across 13 million guests. What was your customer communications setup like before implementing Intercom, and what challenges did you face?
Before Intercom, email was our primary support channel and our customer communications setup was being stretched. We were growing fast, expanding into new countries, and as a result faced several challenges when it came to maintaining our customer service experience.
International expansion meant we needed to provide 24/7 support.
We set up a new offshore support team to scale our efforts and needed a way to ensure standardized communication.
Our service level agreement (SLA) metrics weren’t where we wanted them to be. We struggled to scale the team as our inbound ticket volumes grew, and lacked a consistent escalation workflow, which led to inefficiencies. 
We needed to improve our documentation – both internally, to upgrade our standard operating procedures (SOPs), and externally, to ensure customers had access to all of the help documentation they needed.  What did you need to solve those challenges, and how has implementing Intercom helped?
We set out to tackle the issues we were facing by implementing a number of process improvements and leveraging features in Intercom that would enable us to increase efficiency and maximize our impact.  The key challenges we tackled were: 
Upskilling the support team: We focused on training our support agents and used Intercom’s reporting, along with our own QA process, to monitor performance and ensure our customers were getting a strong, consistent support experience. We leveraged features like Macros and Fin AI Assist to help us ensure that customer communication was standardized across our support and reduce the risk of errors. 
Expanding our support offering: We began offering chat support complemented with outbound phone capabilities, and extended our support availability to be 24/7, allowing us to serve our customers at international scale, whenever they need help. We currently use a third-party platform for phone support, but are testing Intercom Phone in beta right now – having both of these channels in Intercom would reduce the need for “tool switching,” which would save our team valuable time.   
Establishing new SLAs: Our customers’ support requirements had changed and so we adapted our SLAs to meet the new standards. Tracking these metrics daily allowed us to measure progress towards these goals.
Managing increased support volume: While we were redesigning our support operation, our business continued to grow at speed and our ticket volume almost doubled. This proved to be a significant challenge, so we leaned on Intercom features like Fin, their AI chatbot, and reporting capabilities to help us understand how many customers we could empower to self-serve and free up our team’s time, which enabled us to manage this volume spike without increasing headcount. We also reassessed our ticket escalation process and implemented a number of changes to ensure we were able to work through escalations more efficiently.   
Improving the customer – and teammate – experience: By looking at trends in customer conversations and reports in Intercom, we were able to identify high-priority areas that would benefit from new SOPs or help documentation. From there, we created the documentation needed to set both our team and our customers up for success. What results have you seen since you implemented Intercom? Any hard metrics you can share?
Since implementing Intercom, we've seen remarkable improvements across a number of our core metrics as we were able to completely shift how we were delivering support. This brought our first response time from 10-20 minutes with email-only support to under 45 seconds with live chat, our median handling time dropped to under 30 minutes, and our median time to close to just under an hour. 
These improvements have been a game-changer for us, and have also significantly enhanced our customers’ satisfaction. Now, our CSAT scores consistently hit the 3-5 range, showing our customers' delight with our support and increased ability to provide them with faster answers and resolutions to their issues.  How does Intercom fit into the rest of your tech stack? What tools have you connected to Intercom?
Intercom integrates seamlessly with the rest of the tools in our tech stack, which enhances our overall operational efficiency. We've connected several platforms to Intercom to create a comprehensive and well-integrated ecosystem, such as:
Zapier: Zapier helps us automate tasks and connect various apps and tools to Intercom, streamlining our workflows.
HubSpot: Intercom's integration with HubSpot enables us to manage customer relationships effectively and align our marketing and support efforts.
Calendly: Connecting Calendly with Intercom helps us seamlessly schedule support calls with customers so we can provide help when it best suits them.
Omnichannel: With Intercom's omnichannel capabilities, we can provide a consistent customer experience across various support channels.
These integrations have made Intercom the central hub for our customer communications, allowing us to seamlessly manage interactions, streamline processes, and provide a more cohesive and efficient support experience to our customers. What do you think is the biggest benefit of Intercom?
The most significant benefit of Intercom for us is undoubtedly the transparency it brings to our customer service. As the Director of Revenue Operations, I've found that you can't improve what you can't see, and in customer support, a single negative experience or review can have a substantial impact on a company's reputation.
Intercom's real-time visibility into conversations has been a game-changer. It has allowed us to monitor and manage customer interactions effectively, ensuring that we can address issues promptly and maintain a high standard of service. This level of transparency has not only improved our SLA metrics and efficiency but has also been instrumental in safeguarding our customers' satisfaction and our company's reputation. Are there any opportunities you’re excited to unlock with Intercom in the future?
Absolutely, there are a lot of exciting opportunities on the horizon with Intercom. One area we're looking forward to exploring further is Intercom's reporting functionality, like the ability to dig deeper into our data without leaving the Intercom app. As it becomes more advanced, we anticipate that it will be hugely helpful in streamlining our reporting processes and enabling us to quickly identify underlying issues or trends.
We're also keen to dig deeper into our AI-human support experience by splitting out reports based on whether a support agent or bot interacted with or resolved a customer query. A key element of this will be leveraging the ""bot excluded first response time"" metric, which will give us more accurate and real-time reporting on customer interactions and service quality across the board.
Intercom's commitment to innovation and the continuous development of their platform give us confidence that it will continue to play a pivotal role in our ability to deliver exceptional customer support. We're excited about what the future has in store. What advice would you give to others considering using Intercom?
My advice to others considering using Intercom is simple: you get what you put in. Intercom offers the ability to get a bird’s-eye view of your support operation, and also do deep analysis of what’s happening under the hood. The choice you make in terms of how extensively you use the platform will directly impact the quality and actionability of your data.
So, invest time and effort into optimizing your use of Intercom. Explore its capabilities, customize it to suit your needs, and continuously fine-tune your processes based on the insights it provides. The more you engage with Intercom and harness its potential, the greater the impact you can have across your support – and your business."
"Scaling support: How Synthesia meets the needs of a fast-growing customer base with Intercom's AI-powered chatbot, Fin","David Morgan, Revenue Operations Manager at Synthesia, knows a thing or two about rapid growth. As an AI video generation platform, Synthesia has been on the frontlines of the AI revolution that has been unfolding over the past year – and has gained a ton of new customers along the way.
""We were one of the first companies to build a video creation platform powered by generative AI, and, as a result, were also an early adopter of AI throughout our entire business,” says David. “Our goal is to radically change the process of content creation and unleash human creativity for good.""
Working with iconic brands, Synthesia’s customer base has high expectations when it comes to customer service. When David and his team decided to embrace Intercom and its AI-powered chatbot, Fin, they weren’t just looking for a quick fix to help them manage rising support volume. Their goal is to provide the fastest possible service to their customers, so they wanted a long-term solution that would enable them to streamline operations and elevate the entire support experience by providing personal and efficient support. Accelerating customer success
As the business was growing at lightning speed, Synthesia knew that customer service couldn’t take a back seat. With a comprehensive product offering that often prompts questions from customers looking to learn the ropes, the team went in search of a scalable, innovative customer service platform to help them manage their high support volume – which is what brought them to Intercom.
""We have several common topics that just have a huge volume. You know, we're seeing lots of people messaging about any one of these topics on a daily basis,"" says David. ""We're really trying to provide our customers with that perfect experience, and Intercom’s platform seamlessly combines the human support experience with powerful elements of AI, which suits our customers – and our business – down to the ground.” Enter, Fin
As trailblazers in the AI space, Synthesia understands the huge potential AI tools offer when it comes to making support more efficient. They decided to roll out Fin, Intercom’s AI-powered chatbot, to take advantage of the new opportunity. ""Intercom has been very useful for us,"" says David. ""On a monthly basis, we have 35,000 interactions coming to the support team. Without Intercom and Fin, there's no way we'd be able to maintain or monitor that level of traffic.""
David explains that Intercom is helping to bridge the gap between human and AI-driven support, which has been a game-changer for both Synthesia’s team and customers. “Now, we’re able to offer a great self-service experience to our customers and have our human agents jump in to help with more complex issues. It’s the best of both worlds,” he says. “We can also track our customers’ most common issues in Intercom and use those insights to train our support reps, which has been a big help and saved us a lot of time.” Strong inputs = stronger outputs
Integrating Fin was a no-brainer for an AI-first company like Synthesia, but it wasn’t without its hurdles. While the setup was quick, performance took a little more effort.
“When we first turned it on, it didn’t work as well as we’d hoped,” David reveals. The team quickly realized that the broken link was their help content. ""Fin only works as well as the content that you put into it,"" he adds. So, the team took a step back to reassess and fine-tune their content. Once that was done, the impact they saw with Fin was immediate. “We instantly saw a 7% reduction in human-supported requests,” says David. “Improving our content enabled Fin to automatically resolve more of our customers’ queries and freed up our support team’s capacity to focus on larger and more complex issues.”
Within six months, Fin had resolved over 6,000 conversations, saved the team over 1,300 hours and pushed self-serve support rates as high as 87%.
The Synthesia team learned valuable lessons from their initial challenges. ""It wasn't too difficult to implement it, we just had to ensure our content was ready,"" says David. Today, Fin is an essential part of Synthesia's customer service tech stack, aligning perfectly with the team’s vision for rapid but manageable growth. A blueprint for success
For customer support leaders who are tasked with balancing rapid growth with efficient, scalable support, there’s a clear message to be taken away from Synthesia’s experience: the right technology can make all the difference. “Intercom is an innovator in the support space. When it comes to product releases, we hear tickets, we hear Fin – we jump on it,” says David. “Without Intercom or the type of technology they provide, it'd be challenging to manage your business.”"
Hospitable uses Intercom’s AI-powered chatbot Fin to delight customers with lightning-fast support,"Short-term rental management automation software Hospitable has been using Intercom to support its customers for more than six years. With a customer base of hosts who often need to contact support outside of business hours, the Hospitable team was excited to leverage AI to offer around-the-clock support – which is what brought them to Intercom’s new AI-powered chatbot, Fin. Providing fast, always-on support
“What drew us to Fin was simply the pain we were experiencing. We had a big backlog of support queries and were going to need to increase support team headcount to meet the demand,” says Pierre-Camille Hamana, CEO and Founder of Hospitable. “Fin provided us with an alternative solution to this problem. It instantly resolved the 500 support queries that were in the backlog.”
Hospitable was among the first Intercom customers to join the Fin beta. Since then, the team has seen impressive results. Fin is already resolving 30% of all inbound queries it interacts with, saving the Hospitable team valuable time and enabling them to create stand-out support experiences. “We chose Fin over other solutions because in testing, it consistently outperformed others on both speed and accuracy, which were incredibly important to us and our customers,” says Pierre-Camille. “Fin uses information from our comprehensive knowledge base to provide customers with solutions to commonly asked questions. If a question is not covered in our knowledge base, it routes the customer to one of our support agents so they can easily take over and provide further assistance. The handovers between Fin and our support team feel very natural and seamless for our customers, which is a great experience for them. In fact, in a recent poll of new customers, we found that 61% preferred to opt for the faster responses of AI vs waiting to speak with a customer support agent.” Going from strength to strength with AI
With Fin resolving a large portion of inbound queries, Hospitable has been able to keep up with support demand – and even scale its operations – without having to dramatically increase headcount, as well as empower the support team to help customers with queries that require a human touch. These efficiency gains have already resulted in the team reducing response times by 95%. “Collaborating with Intercom and using Fin have allowed us to free up time for our support team to focus on other areas that are impactful for the business and offer a better experience for our customers,” says Pierre-Camille. “I’m excited for the future of our partnership with Intercom as we continue to adopt more of the platform’s AI-powered solutions across our entire support organization.”"
Wolt manages over a million conversations weekly and keeps response time under 60 seconds with Intercom,"European tech company Wolt uses Intercom to support millions of customers and courier partners across 25 countries. With 3,000 people on the support team, Wolt needed a seamless, efficient, and easy-to-use customer service platform that would enable them to create personal experiences at scale.
Pelle Blarke, International Strategy and Operations Manager at Wolt, explains that Intercom was the team’s first choice when they decided to implement messenger-based support. “Intercom and Wolt have had a good partnership for years,” he says. “We use the platform to communicate with both our customers and courier partners, and fast response time is one of the most important things for us when it comes to creating a premium experience. Customers are used to receiving their Wolt orders accurately and quickly. If problems occur – and unfortunately, sometimes they do – we need to be able to solve those even faster. We manage over a million conversations every week, have an average response time of less than 60 seconds, and our CSAT is way over 90%. Intercom enables us to do that.” Choosing a scalable customer service platform
Wolt was a small startup when it first implemented Intercom. The team wanted to ensure that the customer service platform they chose would be able to scale alongside their business. In recent years, Wolt has grown rapidly, now operating in 25 countries. Intercom has empowered the team to continue to offer personalized support throughout this growth, with the platform’s bots and automation enabling them to stay efficient – and most importantly, to delight customers and partners. To adapt to such rapid growth, Pelle explains that having a customer service platform that’s easy to use is critical. “Most of our employees pick up how Intercom works right from the get-go because they are used to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social media platforms,” he says. “Intercom matches the modern-world chat systems and it's really easy for us to onboard and train our teams to use so we can get the most benefit of the platform. And by connecting the other tools in our tech stack with Intercom, our teammates can easily see what’s happening and manage customer and partner conversations in one place. Our support team feels very competent and professional when they work in Intercom. While growing 2x, 8x, 100x, Wolt has been able to keep a high customer satisfaction score of way above 90%. We want to continue to improve, and Intercom is really helping us to do so.” Driving efficiency for customers, partners, and teammates with next-gen tech
Wolt’s support team uses Intercom’s next-generation Inbox as their primary way of communicating with customers and partners. The Inbox allows them to manage all inbound queries in a more efficient way, with powerful automation running behind the scenes to triage and route conversations to the right teammate to help with incoming questions. “The thing that most impressed me about the next-gen Inbox was the speed,” says Pelle. “In a test that we ran, we saw a 15% increase in the number of conversations handled per hour. The Inbox is minimalistic and makes it clear where my focus is supposed to be. This kind of design is next level – and critical for a fast-paced company like ours.”
Wolt leverages Intercom’s bots within Workflows – a visual builder for automations – along with Custom Objects and Custom Actions to boost support efficiency and automate repetitive tasks, which frees up support agents’ time to focus on more complex or urgent queries. “We use Custom Objects and Custom Actions to integrate our own product data with Intercom’s bots so we can guide anyone seeking support through self-serve flows and empower them to resolve some of their own issues,” says Pelle.
“If customers or partners do end up needing to talk to a human, the bots can collect specific information that our team needs to resolve the issue, which saves us a ton of time. Any support associate working at Wolt will have asked the same question 10,000 times to gather the context they need to help, and our bot can ask it 10,001 times with a friendly tone. In fact, 30% of our customers choose to go through the bot flow before they seek human support.” Connecting with customers through real conversations
Something that’s important to Wolt is being able to have personal conversations with customers. “By having a chat system as our support tool, our customers and our support associates can feel like they’re actually having a real conversation – not just a transactional interaction, but a real conversation,” says Pelle. Pelle explains that Intercom gives their team the best of both worlds, enabling both efficient human support and powerful self-serve support. “The best support is no support. In an ideal customer experience, our customers would not need to contact us at all. However, when something does go wrong, we know that we can provide a premium level of support in a scalable way with Intercom, which is critical. We simply wouldn’t be able to provide that level of support to our customers worldwide if we didn’t have a scalable tool like Intercom.” Planning for the future
Reflecting on Wolt’s journey with Intercom so far, Pelle says, “Why do we use Intercom? The number one reason is that we can deliver an amazing customer and partner experience. It’s the premium of the premium experiences. It was the right decision to partner with Intercom back then, and it’s also the right decision today. And I think you can do that as a big company or a small startup. It’s a very powerful tool, and our customers and partners love it.”
Looking ahead, the Wolt team is excited to dive even deeper into the world of support automation. “I have very high expectations of Intercom’s other features as we explore how to further leverage automation to enable our customers and partners to self-serve and continue to delight them with fast, personal support,” says Pelle."
A conversation with trumpet: Leveraging omnichannel messaging to proactively support customers and drive product adoption,"We spoke with Russell Mitchell, Head of Customer Success at trumpet, about how his team uses Intercom to meet customers where they are, provide proactive support and product education to set them up for success using the trumpet platform, and create stand-out experiences that result in increased product adoption. Can you tell us a bit about trumpet and your role?
I’m Russell Mitchell and I’m the Head of Customer Success at trumpet. trumpet allows you to create auto-personalized, collaborative, and interactive microsites to close more deals, quicker. From cold outreach to onboarding, trumpet offers deep analytics to help you understand what “good” looks like and enable your team to speed up deals – with happier buyers. What was your customer communications set-up like before implementing Intercom, and what challenges did you face?
Previously, all of our customer communications were managed via email lists and our CRM. It was difficult to get insights into adoption within our platform and provide an easy way to automatically onboard and educate our users.
On the support side, prior to using Intercom we just had a single support email address that routed to a Gmail inbox. It was difficult to manage for a couple of reasons – we had no way of knowing which tickets were open, closed, or high priority, and we couldn’t easily loop in the development team to collaborate on customer queries. What did you need to solve those challenges, and how has implementing Intercom helped?
We needed a way to effectively track and report on user adoption – as well as move the needle on that number. So we were in need of a solution that would enable us to keep track of progress on the adoption side, as well as provide stellar, timely customer support.
We chose Intercom because it had strong features and capabilities that would allow us to drive results across support, user onboarding, and activation. It offered the ability to host a knowledge base, produce sequenced messaging, and perform in-app education, messaging, and feature announcements that would be critical for setting our customers up for success. We leaned heavily into a lot of the features that Intercom provides to help us do this, such as:
Chat support: We implemented the Intercom Messenger across our platform so users are able to easily raise or flag issues with us directly.
Articles: We built out a knowledge base of help articles to educate our users, provide best practices, and to answer common user questions.
Product Tours: We produced an array of different Product Tours to aid in onboarding, and as a way to quickly introduce new features to our users.
Series: Intercom’s Series feature allowed us to build a fully sequenced onboarding flow that sends our new users the right message at the right time, and ensures they’re fully onboarded and getting the most out of our platform.
Outbound messaging: We use Intercom Banners to introduce new features and share product announcements. We also use the platform’s email capabilities to email groups of users (utilizing custom data attributes in Intercom to segment these out). And we use the Tooltips functionality to provide additional context and user education on our features in-app.
User tracking: Intercom gives us a live overview of all of our users and provides useful data, such as when a user has logged in, and which parts of our platform they’re spending most of their time in. This allows us to identify our super users – as well as unengaged users who we can then reach out to. What results have you seen since you implemented Intercom? Any hard metrics you can share?
Since we started onboarding new users through Intercom, we’ve seen a huge uptick in user adoption. We’re seeing a 3x improvement in our time to value – the length of time it takes users to create 20 “Pods,” which are auto-personalised and interactive microsites that help our customers to close more deals, faster. That time has been shortened from three months to just one, which is amazing.
Being able to scale our onboarding using Intercom’s automation capabilities has also allowed us to move away from a 1:1 onboarding model, which means I’m getting around 20-25% of my week back thanks to our new scaled onboarding program. That’s all made possible by Intercom. Not only that, but we’ve seen a 35% increase in our open rates for onboarding emails. We attribute a lot of this to the data that we’re able to leverage in Intercom so we can ensure we’re sending users the right messages – with relevant messaging – at the right points of their journey with us. If we were to try and build our own in-platform tools to do the jobs of Intercom’s features like Product Tours, Banners, and Tooltips, it would cost us a ton of time and money and severely impact our product roadmap and ability to deliver exciting new features for our users. Intercom’s been an all-rounder for us. It’s empowered us to move the needle on user adoption, as well as provide great support experiences for our customers when they need help. We’ve received a lot of positive feedback from our customers around our timely support since we started using Intercom. How does Intercom fit into the rest of your tech stack? What tools have you connected to Intercom?
We integrated Intercom into our tech stack so that we can ensure all data is shared across our key systems. We also use Intercom’s custom data attributes to pass specific fields across from our app and attach them to the user record in Intercom, so we can use this data to send appropriate messaging based on a user’s actions in our platform.
We have Intercom connected to the following tools:
trumpet: To share our platform data with Intercom so we can track the adoption metrics that we care about.
HubSpot: To pass information like user details and platform actions between the Intercom and HubSpot, which is our CRM.
Slack: To receive instant notifications about support requests.
Canny: To easily share and collect product feedback directly from Intercom. What do you think is the biggest benefit of Intercom?
Having a central source of user and adoption data – it is so valuable to be able to immediately search for a user's name and see all their relevant data and metrics. Are there any opportunities you’re excited to unlock with Intercom in the future?
We will start exploring Intercom’s chatbots in the future, which should save us more time on the support side. We're so excited about the advances in AI tech and how we can use that at trumpet. A tool like Intercom’s new AI-powered chatbot, Fin, would allow us to feed in our help articles and answer customer queries instantly, provide true 24/7 support, and enable our teams to focus on value-add activities for our customers – as well as saving costs on a bigger support team. As a byproduct, I also think it would encourage us to consistently ensure our help articles are up to date. What advice would you give to others considering using Intercom?
Intercom is at its best when you make full use of all of its features and not solely focus on using it as a reactive support tool. Its conversational and omnichannel messaging capabilities enable you to both proactively and reactively help your customers.
For example, being able to create a personalized product tour for someone who has asked a question about a certain feature, and then track how their platform usage changes off the back of this – and being able to have automations trigger based on the subsequent actions taken – is so much more valuable than just giving text-based support to a user. It does involve exploring these additional features and investing the time to get them set up, but it’s worth it.
So my piece of advice would be to think about the ideal journey you’d like your new users to take, and then work backwards from that, utilizing a variety of Intercom features to provide an omnichannel, interactive experience (instead of just emails or chat)."
Zip saved $500k in under 7 months and creates delightful experiences with Intercom,"Zip is a leading “buy now, pay later” company, providing fair and seamless solutions that simplify how people pay. With a growing presence across the globe, the team’s mission is to be the first payment choice. They use Intercom to meet customers where they are and power support in-context, directly in their app and on their website, to create engaging, delightful experiences.
Martin Gohary is the CX Operations Manager at Zip U.S. and oversees all operations related to Zip’s U.S. customer experience. His team handles everything from regulatory complaints and escalations to technical operations for all of the company’s support platforms. Prior to using Intercom, Zip’s primary support channel was email and the team faced efficiency challenges, which made it difficult to produce the level of support they wanted to achieve.
Some of the main challenges Zip needed to solve were:
Finding a more streamlined way of managing customer queries, without overwhelming the team.
Ensuring the team was set up for success to meet Zip’s SLAs for their customers, which their previous support set-up didn’t enable. Finding the right solution to meet customers where they are
Zip knew that without a customer communications platform enabling in-context and in-product messaging and providing powerful bots and automation, it would be impossible to overcome these challenges. By adding Intercom to their tech stack, the team has been able to reach customers in their product and on their website to provide stellar support. Zip is very focused on ensuring customers’ queries are handled as quickly as possible, so they use Intercom features like Resolution Bot, Custom Bots, and other behind-the-scenes automation to offer up instant answers and empower customers to self-serve. Leveraging automation has not only resulted in a great experience and faster resolutions for Zip’s customers, it has also enabled the team to scale their support efficiently, without increasing headcount. In just under seven months, Intercom’s bots and automation saved the Zip team over $500,000.
“I’m a big fan of utilizing technology, because you can hire more people to answer customers’ questions, but it’s expensive and unscalable. Being able to use AI and automation is a 21st-century solution to this problem and only enhances our team’s ability to quickly answer our customers’ common questions,” says Martin. Offering help when and where it’s needed
Zip implemented the Intercom Messenger across their properties to ensure that customers are always able to get the support they need. The team now sees 95% of all inbound queries coming through their app, which shows how many people prefer to receive support directly in the product, precisely when and where they need it. With a consistently high volume of inbound conversations, it’s critical that Zip can lean on some of Intercom’s automation features to help them drive efficiency across their support, and most importantly, delight their customers.
“I’m focused on creating great experiences for both our customers and our team. We want to make sure that our customers are able to get all the support they need from our products, and if they have a problem, that we have a proper pipeline to accelerate those issues to the front line. Internally, we do a lot of work on building out our tools to support this, like creating workflows and automations in Intercom that allow us to move really fast,” says Martin. Driving efficiency with automation
Resolution Bot and Custom Bots play a pivotal role in Zip’s ability to manage their inbound support volume. Here’s a quick look at the results the team is seeing using Intercom’s bots:
Resolution Bot is automatically resolving 33.6% of all inbound conversations.
Zip’s Custom Bot containment rate is sitting at an impressive 68%, meaning that the customers who interact with Custom Bots don’t need to seek further support from the team.
Overall, both Resolution Bot and Custom Bots are contributing to a self-serve support rate of up to 38%, saving both the Zip team and their customers precious time.
Martin’s team uses Intercom to derive insights from customer conversations and understand what their most commonly unanswered questions are. From there, they configure Resolution Bot with these answers so customers can quickly find what they’re looking for and resolve their issues. When customers open the Intercom Messenger on Zip’s website or in their app, Custom Bots are set up to greet and assist them with their query. Customers are offered the ability to self-serve using documentation and answers provided by the bots, and if they would like to speak with a support agent, the bots collect the information needed for the agent to get up to speed quickly. Above all, the Zip team is focused on creating excellent, efficient support experiences for customers. With this automation running behind the scenes, the support team has been able to save their customers significant time, resulting in high levels of customer satisfaction. “Some of the biggest benefits of Intercom are its bots and being able to support our customers in real time. Since implementing Resolution Bot and Custom Bots, our resolved by self-serve support rate has climbed to a healthy range of 34–38%, which saves our customers time and makes their experience more efficient,” says Martin. Driving business impact with Intercom reports
The Zip team leverages Intercom’s reports to analyze trends in customer conversations and utilize these insights to drive improvements across the company. Martin explains that these insights allow them to identify their customers’ precise needs and share them with other teams. “I’m a big fan of the fact that you can easily schedule reports through Intercom to share with the rest of the company,” says Martin. “We have to get data to the product and engineering teams so they can make decisions, and thanks to Intercom, it’s seamless to extract the data and share that out so everyone has visibility over what our customers are saying.” “It’s great how granular we can get with these reports. When we’re sending them to the product team, for example, they don’t just want to hear that the app’s not working, they need to have specific details. We’re able to pull all of that data for them from Intercom, like which version of an operating system or device a customer is using, where in the journey they’re running into the issue, and other helpful information like that,” he says.
The CX Operations team also leverages Intercom’s reports to communicate progress and performance to Zip’s executive team, enabling them to continually demonstrate the speed and efficiency with which the team can support their customers – and the bottom-line impact that efficiency has. Enhancing the support tech stack
Intercom is a key part of Zip’s support tech stack, empowering the team to communicate with customers in-context and meet them where they are. Zip also uses Zendesk for email and voice support, and as their ticketing system to manage escalations. With Intercom and Zendesk integrated, the team can ensure that their workflows can seamlessly pass from one tool to another as they work through customers’ issues.
“When agents need to escalate something, they’ll push it to Zendesk and we have an internal team that focuses on escalations that can take it from there. The Intercom integration with Zendesk has worked really well for us,” says Martin.
Zip also integrates Intercom with Playvox, a support quality assurance platform, to do automated analysis of customer conversations in order to drive continuous improvement. Producing results
Since implementing Intercom to power its support, Zip has seen impressive results. The platform’s bots and automation have been hugely helpful in empowering the team to efficiently manage conversation volume and ensure they’re consistently providing a stellar experience for their customers.
“Intercom’s bots have had a great impact on both our company and our customers, and you can see that in our results,” says Martin. Planning for the future
Looking ahead, the Zip team has plans to drive even more efficiency across their support and continue to build out their tech stack with new Intercom innovations. With new channels and capabilities consistently being added to the Intercom platform, they’re excited about the opportunity to find new ways to support their customers. “We’re looking forward to working with Intercom’s Product and Engineering teams to connect Custom Bots to the rest of our systems through the API and exploring new features like Switch and SMS,” says Martin. “We want to continue to find ways of creating great experiences for our customers in a way that’s really efficient for our team. That’s another thing I really like about Intercom, they give us access to betas because they know we always want to try new things. It’s always exciting to see what’s being built, so it’s cool that we have that relationship with Intercom. It makes it a great experience for us too. As more teams at Zip start using Intercom, I think it has the potential to become an all-inclusive customer experience platform for us.”"
Coda achieves over 95% CSAT and creates personalized experiences at scale with Intercom,"All-in-one doc software Coda provides a powerful tool that combines word-processing, spreadsheet, and database functions in one place. As a result of that flexibility, its customers use it in countless different ways. Coda uses Intercom to power customer communications across the entire user journey and create tailored, in-context experiences to set their customers up for success based on their needs.
Brian Lederman, Head of Sales, Support, and Success at Coda, explains that the team wants customer support and the customer experience to be key differentiators for their business. In fact, it’s one of their core operating principles. “We can do a lot of things for a lot of different people, and that means that we have no one-size-fits-all approach to the customer experience,” he says. Coda uses Intercom to power in-context messaging across customer support and engagement, leveraging the Intercom Messenger and Outbound Messages to meet customers where they are. With Intercom at the helm of its communications, the team is empowered to create stand-out experiences, leverage data to personalize their customers’ journeys with Coda, and drive ongoing engagement. “Intercom's really been a big part of the customer experience since day one,” says Brian. “I'm pretty sure we had Intercom before we had any customers, actually.” Having experienced a huge wave of growth in recent years, the team’s use of the platform has evolved from powering their support to it now being a core piece of their communications tech stack. Intercom’s flexibility ensures that as Coda continues to grow, they can still provide the highly personalized experiences their customers expect – at scale. A one-size-fits-all approach to customer communication doesn’t work
With a highly customizable product that varies in complexity, it’s critical that Coda can deeply understand its users in order to personalize their experiences and meet their exact needs. “One of the things about having a very horizontal product is that it's difficult to provide a very contextual experience for each individual user,” says Brian. “Intercom really helps us understand our user personas and where they are in their journey with Coda so that we can continue to provide a really rich and personal experience based on who they are … and where they are in their experience with our product.” This deep understanding of customer personas and behavior enables the team to trigger targeted messages from Intercom based on a customer’s role within their workspace, their Coda skill level – which ranges from beginner to advanced – or actions they take within the product. They can also leverage Intercom’s powerful automation capabilities, like Custom Bots, to collect valuable information about customers’ queries, drive further efficiency across their support with smart routing rules, and enhance their customers’ experiences through faster replies and resolutions. “Since we introduced Custom Bots, our Support team has been able to save time and reduce their median reply count for certain queries by 57% – from seven replies to just three,” says Brian. Coda has also customized the Intercom Inbox to make managing inbound conversations more efficient, with dedicated team inboxes to ensure queries are routed to the right place to get support. Leveraging feedback to drive action
Collecting feedback from customers at the precise moment they’re experiencing something is an important step in gaining a deep understanding of their journey with your product. Coda uses Intercom Surveys during the onboarding process and to measure NPS in order to contextualize customers’ experiences and drive action based on direct, in-the-moment feedback. Using the Coda and Intercom integration, Brian explains that the team has been able to leverage the insights they’re getting from Surveys and share them across the company. “We want to provide a more contextualized and personal experience based on user feedback. So, once we capture the information, we can then synthesize it for our teams and then use that data to power downstream behavior,” says Brian. “As an example, if we have a survey result that maybe was a bit of a detractor, somebody who was having a negative or not-so-great experience on their onboarding journey with Coda, we can then take that information and get it in the hands of a CSM or someone on the support side to step in at the right moment.” Building a seamless customer experience
Brian notes that the ability to engage with customers and collect feedback in-product using Surveys is a seamless and elegant experience for their customers. “We feel like we're getting really good responses with relevant information,” he says. “The idea that we can provide the right level of interaction to meet the customer in their moment of need and turn a frustration into a moment of delight has been really powerful. We have very happy customers as well. We want to take those moments of delight and amplify them.” This is evident from the team’s high customer satisfaction scores, which consistently sit above 95%. A tech stack built for scale
As Coda continues to grow, it’s important for teams from across the company to be able to use tools that set them up for success – without sacrificing data integrity. They have heavily integrated Intercom with the other tools they use, like their CRM – and, of course, their own product – to ensure that they can collaborate seamlessly with other teams while maintaining a single source of truth for customer communication. “We rely really heavily on the Intercom Pack – the integration that we have with Intercom – to pull in a lot of really rich user data and customer experience data into Coda,” he says. “That gives us the ability to synthesize and analyze this information, and of course, collaborate and share it across the rest of the company. Everybody at Coda wants to know what our customers are saying, so it's great that we can amplify the voice of the customer across the whole organization.” Being able to integrate with the tools they need to adopt as they scale is crucial for the team as they look to the future. “We use Salesforce on the sales and marketing side, so we have Intercom integrated really seamlessly into our CRM. This enables us to really provide all the necessary user detail and customer information all in one place,” he says. “So, regardless of the system each team is using, we still have that same single source of truth with Intercom.” By having their systems in sync and leveraging customer data from multiple sources in Intercom, Coda can completely tailor their customer messaging, create a better user experience, and save valuable time. Looking to the future, Brian and the team at Coda are excited about the opportunity that lies ahead with Intercom. “We need to continue to deliver that same level of customer experience at scale. We're growing incredibly rapidly and we need a tool to really be nimble and agile and grow with us,” says Brian. “This year is a really important year for us as we open up more omnichannel experiences, and we're looking forward to partnering with the Intercom team to provide more ways for customers to communicate with us.”
At our recent New at Intercom event, we invited Brian to speak with our Chief Product Officer Paul Adams about how Coda is creating great customer experiences while also driving growth across their business. Check out the keynote session here. Check out the rest of our stories"
"Webex Events uses Intercom to provide stellar support, create world-class customer experiences, and drive more leads","End-to-end event management platform Webex Events needed to provide stellar support and customer experiences at scale. With a customer roster that includes household names like Apple, Kampgrounds of America, OneCause, and Under Armour, having a solution that could balance personalization with efficiency and empower them to create next-level experiences was critical for the team.
Prior to being acquired by Cisco in 2021, Webex Events was known as Socio, a companion app for events that allowed attendees to see event agendas, speaker information, and network with other attendees. The Socio team initially began using Intercom as a support platform in 2017 and has expanded over the last six years. Now, as part of Cisco, they use the platform to support and connect with customers throughout the lifecycle, as well as interact with prospective customers that visit their website and qualify leads for the Sales team. Operating in the events industry, Socio was greatly impacted by the onset of the pandemic in 2020. The team quickly adapted their product for virtual events. During this time, the need for an effective customer service platform became more crucial than ever. They leveraged Intercom to stay in close contact with their customers and set them up for success running events in the new digital-first world. The success that the team saw after this pivot caught the eye of technology conglomerate corporation Cisco, and eventually led to Socio being acquired and becoming Webex Events. Since then, Intercom has continued to enable personalized support and engagement at scale for the company’s rapidly-growing customer base. Choosing the right platform
When the Webex Events (formerly Socio) team first evaluated support platforms in 2017, Joe Watkins, the company’s Chief Customer Officer and a co-founder, notes that Intercom was a cut above the rest in terms of its ability to power in-product messaging through the Messenger. “We looked at some other platforms, but Intercom stood out as being a great product and more focused on the customer than the other solutions, which is why we decided to go with it,” says Joe. “The other thing that we really liked was that Intercom was chat-first, whereas other platforms were ticketing-first, chat-second, which we didn’t feel aligned with our support goals.”
Joe notes that he had a number of requirements in mind when searching for a support platform, such as the ability to:
Offer customers messenger-based chat support and use emojis and gifs to match the company’s fun and playful tone and brand.
Host a robust knowledge base for help documentation.
Enable pop-up messages directly in the Webex Events (formerly Socio) platform.
Provide powerful automation to efficiently scale support as the company grew.
Intercom fit the bill when it came to the Webex Events team’s needs and offered the ability to expand to other use cases over time, which is why the team chose the platform to power its customer messaging. Creating an engaging experience from day one
From the moment a new customer signs up for Webex Events or purchases a product, they’re led through a personalized journey to help them get up and running quickly and easily. Webex Events has a large portfolio of products, which means that customers can purchase any number of product combinations to meet their needs. With such a customizable offering, being able to personalize each customer’s journey from day one is of the utmost importance to the team.
“Now that we’re part of a Fortune 100 company, we have a more sophisticated suite of products, and we therefore need more sophisticated customer communications and targeting,” says Kara Gladish, Manager of Customer Experience at Webex Events. “Intercom has been a big help in enabling us to segment our customer base and personalize messaging in that way.” Setting customers up for success
The Webex Events customer onboarding journey is powered using Intercom Series and checklists, which enables the team to bring new customers on a tailored walkthrough of their product sets to help set them up for success. “When a new user signs up, they get a welcome tour that shows them around the basics of the workspace and where to go to get help and resources,” says Clint Sheets, Customer Experience Specialist at Webex Events. “Our welcome experience is all built within a Series. The welcome tour completion rate is currently sitting at 39%, compared with the industry average of 23%, and the 8% completion rate we were seeing with our previous solution. It’s incredible how granular we can get with the targeting of these messages. It’s much more personalized now, and far more scalable."" Webex Events also uses Intercom’s Engage solution to communicate with customers about important product updates. “Intercom’s our source of truth when it comes to our customers,” says Kara. “We’ve built our customer newsletter in Intercom, and we also share monthly product announcements using its outbound messaging capabilities. Most recently, we’ve started using tooltips in these announcements to show people the new features that we’re launching, which is crucial in a competitive and fast-paced industry.” A one-stop shop for customer service
Throughout the welcome journey and beyond, Webex Events puts a great deal of focus on letting customers know how and where they can get support. It’s important to the team that customers have the option of speaking directly with Support and also have the option to self-serve, if they prefer. To ensure customers can receive the type of support that they want, the team leverages Intercom’s automation, Articles feature, and inbox management capabilities to make their support efficient and scalable, as well as to create educational content for customers who’d like to self-serve answers to their own questions.
“We have different types of customers, so we need to be able to serve all of their different needs,” says Kara. “We use Intercom for human support, but also as a resource for our self-service customers, and it plays a huge role in us being able to help them be successful. They get checklists, product tours, outbound messages, and help documentation from us to provide product education throughout their journey, and they can always reach out to our Support team if they need extra help.” Anthony Miller, Director of Global Support at Webex Events, explains that Intercom is at the helm of the company’s support operation. The team uses the platform to manage all inbound customer queries, host their help center, and monitor support performance to ensure customers are always getting a stand-out experience. And with an award-winning Support team, it’s no surprise that their customer satisfaction score sits at a staggering 99%. “We’ve consolidated all of our support into Intercom and our results have continued to trend upwards,” says Anthony. “It’s also helped us to reduce the cost of our support overall. We have 99% five-star ratings and our response time is under five minutes – Intercom empowers us to do that.” Since adopting Intercom in 2017, many of the initial requirements the Webex Events (formerly Socio) team had for a customer support solution have become their favorite elements of the platform. “Our culture is fun, so being able to use gifs and emojis has been absolutely huge for us. We often get comments from customers saying, ‘I never knew support could be so fun,’” says Kara. “We have an award-winning Support team and they’re the heart of our company. When they use the gifs and emojis, our customers just have a ball. We’ve built our culture around that. Intercom’s personal communication style has been really core to our culture and personality, even as we’ve grown from a company with 20 people to one with 200 people.” Driving sales with the Intercom Messenger
In addition to customer support and engagement, the Webex Events Sales team uses Intercom to engage with prospective customers that visit their website. They have set up a bot to greet site visitors and ask for information to understand what those visitors need, so they can qualify and connect them with the right teammate to help them with their query. “One of our sales reps shared that right after launching the bot, the number of qualified leads that they received increased by 154%, and it’s due to the information these leads are proactively providing,” Kara says. Focusing on the future
Having already seen such success using Intercom for customer support, engagement, and sales, Webex Events has plans to continue building on the customer experience and leveraging more of Intercom’s features to delight customers.
“We have lots of ideas for our customer journey and how we can optimize it even more,” says Clint. “For instance, we want to use Intercom Surveys to ask customers about their goals and what it is that they want to accomplish so we can use those insights to further personalize our Series based on what’s most relevant for them.” When it comes to support, the team also has plans to dive deeper into bots and automation to help them scale, drive increased efficiency, and optimize the Support team’s time. Looking to the future, Kara points to the huge growth opportunity that lies ahead of Webex Events, noting that the team is confident that Intercom will continue to scale alongside them. “I can’t imagine our company without Intercom,” she says. “It’s been with us from the early startup stage to us growing and becoming part of Cisco. We’re excited for what the future holds for our partnership with Intercom.” Check out the rest of our stories"
A conversation with Fathom: Providing award-winning customer service,"We caught up with Adam Wilson, Global Head of Customer Support at Fathom, about how his team approaches customer support, the obstacles they’ve had to overcome, and the role Intercom plays in providing stand-out, award-winning support to their customers. Adam, can you tell us a bit about Fathom and your role?
Sure! I’m Adam Wilson, the Global Head of Customer Support at Fathom, a platform for financial reporting, insights, and forecasting. What did your customer support tech stack look like before Intercom, and what challenges did you face?
Before Intercom, we used Zendesk for our customer support, but the platform wasn’t working for most of our team as the interface was hard to navigate. We needed a solution that would not only work for everyone, but that could also pull all of our support together under one roof.
Our core focus was being able to provide fast, accurate support to our customers. Some of our customers need instant responses while they're working on a report or a forecast, while others would prefer to send us an email that they can return to later. The key is meeting both of those needs without creating divergent processes that introduce failure points, and we saw that Intercom would allow us to do that. Since making the switch, how has Intercom helped you to solve those challenges?
Intercom has enabled us to focus on the customer’s needs and specific issues rather than the mechanics of providing support. This, in turn, has allowed us to deliver the highest levels of customer satisfaction and short response times across every region. Our customer satisfaction score is consistently above 95% – in fact, it’s currently 97%. And we’re now able to respond to customers more than 60% faster than we were with our previous solution. We just won the “Customer Service Organization of the Year” award at the 2022 Australian Service Excellence Awards, which was such an incredible achievement for our team, and was recognized by Anthony Albanese, the Australian Prime Minister! In addition to that, the simplicity of Intercom really stood out to us. We wanted a single platform that would be easy to use so our team could focus on helping our customers, rather than spending a lot of time navigating between different tools to resolve customer queries.
Intercom’s recent addition of the real-time dashboard has also been very positive. I can get a snapshot of support activity and performance across my teams, which is good. We're a small team and a small company, but it's great to get that bird’s-eye view, and I can share that with the leadership team as well. That's a good quality-of-life improvement for customer support organizations. It’s really powerful and helpful. Another benefit of having a single support solution is that we can host all of our support articles in Intercom and easily share them with customers via the Messenger. The experience is all linked, which makes it more seamless for the customer and our team. In contrast to previous companies I’ve worked at, where we used a wide range of in-house systems that required a lot of manual work, the unified solution that Intercom offers is incredibly simple and powerful in its approach. How does Intercom fit into the rest of your tech stack? What tools have you integrated with Intercom?
We use Zoom for our customer support escalations, and we’ve integrated Calendly with Intercom to schedule these escalation calls directly from conversations in the Inbox. We also use Loom to capture helpful product walkthroughs and deliver customer education.
To simplify escalations and product feedback, we’ve connected Intercom to Jira for our development and support escalations and to Productboard for feature requests and tracking product enhancements. Finally, we use Guru for internal product knowledge, which seamlessly integrates with our workflows in Intercom. Having everything connected makes it much easier for the team to work and saves us valuable time."
Inter efficiently manages 60k customer conversations daily and keeps FRT under a minute with Intercom,"More than a digital bank, Inter is a super app that has reinvented itself to simplify the lives of its more than 20 million customers. The company adds new products and services to its app every day, giving customers the opportunity to manage their finances, shop online, get cash back, and much more.
Inter currently offers a complete set of services in banking, investments, credit and insurance, international money transfers, as well as a shopping app that includes the biggest retail stores in Brazil and the United States. The team uses Intercom’s customer service platform to build relationships with their customers, leveraging its self-serve support capabilities to boost efficiency across the business – and delight users. “Innovation is central to everything that we do,” says Lais Belico, Solutions & Client Experience Analyst at Inter. “We wanted an innovative support solution that could scale with us as we continue to expand our service offering.” Challenge
Inter’s previous support set-up was challenging for the team to manage as they needed humans to answer every inbound query and phone call, which was expensive and not scalable. This also meant that if unexpected surges in inbound conversation volume occurred, the team was easily overwhelmed.
On top of that, not having a centralized platform for tracking support queries in real time meant that customer calls outside of business hours could get lost, with no way for the team to track who was calling and why. Inter needed to find more efficient ways of managing their support, and a solution that would enable the team to keep track and stay on top of inbound conversation volume. Solution
With Intercom’s customer service platform, Inter can leverage powerful support management capabilities to set both the team and its millions of customers up for success. The company is committed to answering customers’ queries within two minutes, so it’s crucial that they have the tools and integrations available to them to help them do this. “Intercom has a lot of tools that help us manage volume spikes,” says Lais. “For example, if we see an increase in chat interactions beyond what we expected, we know something has happened. In these situations, we can go into Intercom and see what our customers are saying to identify the issue and proactively resolve it.” Since Inter started using Intercom, it has seen its support conversation volume increase dramatically. According to Lais, “The platform has been able to scale with us, allowing us to easily manage the growth. We started out with 11,000 customers contacting us through Intercom every day, and since then, that number has grown to 60,000.” By being able to keyword search in Intercom, the Inter team can analyze trends in customer conversations and take measures to proactively support them in order to drive down support conversation volume over time. Inter has also linked Intercom to its social media support channels so the team can monitor customer complaints and easily reference their conversation history in Intercom. Providing support at scale with self-serve support and an interoperable tech stack
As a fully-digital business, Inter’s focus is on creating stand-out digital experiences for its customers. The team leverages Intercom’s self-serve support capabilities, such as Articles, to power their help center. They also utilize several integrations in order to meet the expectations of customers who prefer to receive digital support. “Our customers are used to digital platforms, so they like to have self-serve support as an option,” says Lais. “We know that they like to try and resolve issues themselves, which is why we leverage bots and automation.” Inter had previously invested in an IBM Watson chatbot, which the team calls ""Babi."" Lais shares, ""Babi is our virtual customer support assistant and the first point of contact with our team when they need help.”
When searching for a customer service platform, it was important for Inter to be able to integrate the new technology with Babi. Fortunately, with the Intercom and IBM Watson integration, Inter was able to retain the power of Babi, while also adding new capabilities to its support offering with Intercom. The virtual assistant is set up in Intercom as a user, allowing Inter to access its data, conversation history, response time, and questions answered. “Having all of this in Intercom is hugely helpful for our team, as we’re able to use the conversation history and insights to curate content for Babi,” says Lais. To ensure the team has all the necessary tools to help customers efficiently, Inter also integrates Intercom with its CRM system, Salesforce. With these two platforms integrated, Inter’s support agents can quickly get all the context they need to resolve customers’ queries, such as their account information, conversation history, and more.
“It’s great that Intercom houses all of our conversation history with customers. Our support agents can use it as their first port of call, and can also access our CRM to analyze customers’ profiles. Having everything integrated is a big help because it simplifies and speeds up interactions,” says Lais. Measuring success
When it comes to measuring the success of its customer support program, Inter looks at a number of important metrics, including the team’s first-response time, NPS, and the resolution rate of its chatbot, Babi. Using Babi integrated with Intercom to resolve 60% of support requests, the team can be freed up to focus on complex or urgent issues. And with an NPS score of 81 (based on Inter's last NPS release for active customers), it's evident that customers are receiving stand-out support experiences.
“Currently, Inter has a first response time of less than one minute, which directly impacts customer satisfaction. Without a doubt, Intercom has helped us massively as we’ve scaled. Our customer contacts very quickly grew to 60,000 per day, and Intercom has handled that evolution very well,” says Lais."
Simply (formerly JoyTunes) reduced response times by 99% and creates joyful support experiences for millions of learners,"Challenge
Simply is the company behind renowned music learning apps Simply Piano and Simply Guitar. Previously, Simply's Support team was split into specialist groups that helped learners – which is what Simply calls its customers – with questions related to dedicated topics, but they found that the requests they were receiving often spanned multiple topic areas.
This resulted in an inefficient way of working for the team, and sometimes left learners waiting over 10 hours for a reply. Simply is committed to creating “wow” experiences for its learners, which long wait times weren’t enabling the team to do. So, they knew that they needed to make changes that would allow them to drive efficiency and keep response times to a minimum – and truly provide learners with the “wow” experience they pride themselves on. Solution
""We don’t want to make it hard for people to talk to us,"" says Liran Biderman, Head of Learner Experience at Simply. ""If someone needs help, we’re going to be there for them.” With that in mind, the team at Simply implemented a number of changes to help them streamline their support.
First, they reconsidered their specialist Support team model. By combining these specialist groups into a single team to help learners with any and all queries, they would be able to tackle inbound questions more quickly and efficiently – so that’s precisely what they did. Once the team had been restructured, Simply turned to Intercom’s customer communications platform to help them build a stellar customer experience.  With the Intercom Inbox, Simply’s support agents can get a holistic view of their learners and the issues they’re experiencing, enabling them to respond to and resolve queries quickly. Within just a month of implementing these changes, learners’ wait times were reduced by a staggering 98.7%. That reduction has since grown to 99.8%, with response times sitting at 90 seconds. “Our learners often reach out to us for help while they’re learning how to play an instrument, so it’s critical that we’re able to get back to them quickly, all while maintaining our unique tone of voice and care-bear attitude so they feel that we’re there for them,"" says Liran. ""With Intercom, we’ve reduced our median response time from over 10 hours to just one and a half minutes, and still provide a mind-blowing support experience."" Having seen such impressive results, Simply then turned to Intercom’s automation and self-service features to further boost efficiency. By leveraging Custom Bots and adding the ability for learners to search for help articles directly in the Intercom Messenger, Simply was able to automatically resolve common queries, which not only saved the team time, but also provided learners with instant answers and boosted satisfaction, as a result. In fact, this change resulted in a 6.3% increase in 5/5 CSAT – the team’s core KPI. While streamlining their support, Simply closely monitored their 5/5 CSAT to ensure that learner satisfaction remained high and that they continued to enjoy truly “wow” experiences.
Intercom’s Custom Bots have also been a big help in triaging requests that need some additional support from the team, ensuring that Simply’s support agents have all the context they need to set learners up for success – fast. The team has seen impressive results using Intercom’s bots and automation capabilities, with 20–30% of common queries being resolved through self-serve support. With Intercom's help, Simply is creating stand-out support experiences and building strong, lasting relationships with its learners."
Motosumo achieves 93% CSAT and doubled its trial-to-paid conversion rate with Intercom,"Challenge
Before using Intercom to power its communications, indoor cycling app Motosumo found it challenging to keep track of customer conversations. Following up on emails was complex and a very manual process, and not having a platform for managing support conversations meant that a lot of time was wasted having to manually assign conversations to teammates.
The team went in search of a solution that would enable them to reach out to customers in a more cohesive way. As they transitioned from a B2B to B2C model, they had to find new and innovative ways to engage with their customers, which their previous email set-up didn't allow. They wanted a single communications platform that would integrate with the rest of their tech stack and enable them to create a better customer experience. Solution
Motosumo uses Intercom to power customer support and engagement. This allows them to streamline their workflows and create better and more consistent experiences across the customer lifecycle. Providing efficient, personal support
The Intercom Inbox serves as a single home for customer conversations. With everything being managed in one platform, support reps are empowered to collaborate with other teammates more effectively, easily keep track of customer conversations and history, and provide faster resolutions for customers. By leveraging Intercom's inbox management capabilities, Motosumo has reduced the number of manual tasks needed to resolve customers' queries, resulting in the team saving time overall, and customer satisfaction remaining high. In fact, the team's CSAT score currently sits at an impressive 93%. Engaging customers in the right place and at the right time
As a B2C company, Motosumo can now avail of Intercom's outbound messaging options – such as email, mobile carousels, and push notifications – to ensure they meet customers where they are. This has enabled them to be more proactive in their customer engagement and do A/B test messaging without developer support.
Using Intercom's visual campaign builder, Series, to engage with new trial users, the team has doubled their trial-to-paid conversion rate. The team is also seeing open rates of up to 50% on emails triggered based on user action. Creating consistent experiences at every touchpoint
Intercom integrates with a number of tools in Motosumo's tech stack, such as Slack, Google Analytics, Stripe, Calendly, Segment, and more, which allows the team to sync data across their core systems and derive insights they can use to build great, consistent experiences for their customers. With all of its core tools connected to Intercom and multiple teams using a single platform, Motosumo is empowered to provide stellar customer support and engagement at every stage of the lifecycle. ""Having our Support and Customer Success teams working in a single platform saves us a lot of time and makes it easy to create strong experiences for our customers, says Jens Juel Jensen, Chief Product Owner at Motosumo. ""We’re seeing the benefits of that in our results – our CSAT is at 93% and we’re converting 200% more trial users to paid plans since we started using Series to engage with them."""
Pitch achieves up to 100% CSAT using Intercom,"Germany-based presentation software Pitch is on a mission to enable every team’s best thinking through beautiful and effective presentations. The team is committed to facilitating better real-time collaboration and empowering their customers to work more efficiently. They use Intercom to stay close to customers and create delightful experiences for them at every stage of their journey.
Since launching in 2020, Pitch and its customer base have grown significantly. To support this growth, the team needed a communications solution that would enable them to maintain a personal touch with their customers at scale. Knowing their customers value communications that balance speed and efficiency with empathy and personalization, they chose Intercom to power their messaging across support, sales, and customer engagement. Choosing the right platform to do more with less
Verena Kuhn heads up the Community Support team at Pitch and is focused on ensuring their customers are maximizing their use of the product and set up for success. With a small but growing team, the ability to do more with less was a crucial deciding factor for Pitch when choosing a customer communications platform. When looking at the solutions available to them, Verena notes that they wanted a platform that would mirror their commitment to quality. Pitch champions excellence in its product and the presentations it empowers its customers to create. The team knew they needed a communications experience that would go hand in hand with that, which Intercom provides. ""We found Intercom's UI much more intuitive than the other products we looked at,” says Verena. “My team works in Intercom every day and we pay such attention to detail, design, and user experience as a company, so it was really important to us. My team should enjoy the platform they use, and their feedback was that they enjoyed working in Intercom the most."" Pitch adopted Intercom before launching to the public and have used it since the beginning of their journey. They did evaluate other tools, like Zendesk, to power their support, but ultimately chose Intercom for a number of key reasons:
They wanted a solution that would accommodate future growth and liked that Intercom had a wide feature set that they could expand into as the team evolved.
Intercom integrates seamlessly with their web, desktop, and mobile apps and works out of the box, which was a huge help to the team. After the initial implementation, the team was able to configure Intercom to work for them without engineering resources, which was a big advantage.
The team highlights Intercom’s ease of use as being a crucial factor in their decision. They’re able to seamlessly onboard new hires and collaborate smoothly across teams.
The bots and automation capabilities Intercom provides enable Pitch to offer support at scale without having to dramatically increase the team’s headcount.
Intercom’s UI was more intuitive than the other tools they looked at, and it was important to the team that the platform they chose mirrored their own focus on user-centered design.
Verena notes that having come from a ticket-based support platform background, she was pleasantly surprised at Intercom’s functionality and the power of having a holistic customer communications platform. ""I hadn't worked with Intercom before Pitch, and I was actually pretty set on bringing on a ticketing system. But after a thorough evaluation, Intercom was our top choice,” she says. “I definitely think it improves the customer experience, and maybe I was coming at it from a bit of an old-fashioned angle of filling out forms to get support. But nobody likes filling out forms, you'd much rather have a conversation with someone instead."" Unlocking the ability to scale
When Verena joined Pitch in 2019, there were a number of core challenges she needed to solve. The biggest challenge, she explains, was building out the team from scratch and scaling their operation, all while onboarding their very first customers. In order to do this efficiently, Verena needed a solution she could rely on to help her manage rising conversation volumes without having to hire a ton of additional people to meet the demand. ""It was important to me that our support platform was set up in a way that's easy for my team to work with in case we ever get overwhelmed with volume — which, luckily, hasn't happened yet because we've set up priority inboxes and use Macros to help us be efficient,"" she says.
The main things Verena wanted to accomplish when she first set out on her journey to scale Pitch’s support were:
Setting up support intake channels and an internal routing system to manage inbound requests.
Leverage detailed reporting to monitor the performance and drive continuous improvement.
Create a robust help center that was aligned with Pitch’s brand.
Above all, striking the balance between making things efficient for the team and their customers and being empathetic and personal in their replies was of the utmost importance to Pitch, which Intercom enables them to do. The team leverages a combination of Intercom’s proactive, self-serve, and human support features to ensure their customers’ needs are being met at every stage of their journey. And the results speak for themselves. The team has been able to drive down inbound conversation volume with the help of bots and automation, freeing up the support team’s time to focus on complex questions that need a bit of extra help. Something Verena highlights is that leveraging these efficiencies hasn’t impacted the customer experience, which is obvious from the team’s high CSAT scores, which consistently sit between 96% and 100%. Preemptively providing support when it’s needed
Verena explains that her team endeavors to proactively offer their customers help wherever they can. They use the custom greeting in the Intercom Messenger to notify customers of any changes to their coverage times, for example, during the holiday season, so expectations are clearly set and there’s no confusion over when they can expect a response. Having an unobtrusive way to let customers know when they can expect a response ultimately reduces possible friction for the customer and results in a better experience.
Looking ahead, Verena plans to leverage more of Intercom’s proactive support capabilities to build out this function. Currently, they’re focused on proactively building out their help center content to ensure customers have access to educational content about new features or product improvements, and they also analyze popular search terms and questions to help them preempt what content customers are going to need. ""I'd love to tap more into proactive support – really detecting what they're doing, what they're not doing, and what it looks like they wanted to do so can proactively help them,” says Verena. “I think that would be a really great customer experience."" Enabling customers to self-serve
For any fast-growing business, the ability to make processes and workflows more efficient and scalable is critical for success. Leveraging Intercom’s self-serve support capabilities, like bots and automation, has enabled the team at Pitch to drive efficiency across multiple areas of their customer communications, as well as operate at scale. They rely on Articles to power their help center, which they invested in early on in their journey with the platform. When customers need support, their first port of call is Pitch’s help center. Here, they can search through all of their help articles to find the answers they’re looking for. The Community Support team creates new content for every new feature and product update the team ships in order to support and educate their customers. In doing this, they’re able to reduce the number of conversations reaching the Support team, as well as enhance the customer experience by offering up answers fast and efficiently. If customers are unable to find an answer or need additional help, they can open the Messenger and start a conversation with the team. “When customers get stuck, of course there’s a risk of churn. We want to unblock them as fast as possible, and sometimes the fastest way of doing that is to enable them to find answers themselves,” says Verena. “I think it’s really powerful to surface that option, but also make it easy to contact my team.” Verena’s team is using Custom Bots to triage all incoming queries by collecting valuable information about the type of issue a customer is experiencing and any other information that could be useful to help resolve it. The bots help to determine when a customer needs immediate help so they can be directed straight to the Support team, or if their query is something that can be easily resolved through self-serve support. This helps the team categorize incoming queries and prioritize. Being able to categorize incoming conversations by issue and customer type has been pivotal in helping the team manage their internal SLAs, which are individually tracked for each type of query. Making the most of a flexible platform
Verena highlights Intercom’s apps and integrations as a huge advantage of the platform. Being able to seamlessly connect the tools in their tech stack has enabled the Support team to save time that would otherwise have been spent switching between tools, as well as work cross-functionally with other teams. Some of the integrations Pitch uses are:
GitHub, which is used for filing bugs for the Engineering team to assess. With the Intercom integration, this can be done directly from the customer conversation, which saves valuable time and enables the support team to respond to customers easily once the issue has been resolved.
Canny, which is used for tracking new feature requests from customers.
HubSpot, which is used by both the Sales and Customer Success teams. Sales leverage the integration to create contacts with just one click, saving them a lot of time. On the Customer Success team, the data sync between Intercom and HubSpot enables them to see which customers have contacted support.
By leveraging tagging in Intercom to help funnel customer queries, requests, and suggestions into these workflows has been hugely helpful for Pitch and enables smooth collaboration between teams. Verena also points to the importance of having everything the team needs in a single platform to reduce the need for tool switching. In the case that a teammate does need to access another resource, they can quickly add them to the “Quick Links” section of their Inbox view to be able to access them in seconds. This is something the team uses extensively and is a big time-saver. “We want to consolidate as much as we can into Intercom — in fact, our next step is to integrate our internal admin tool directly as a widget in the Inbox,” Verena explains. Building great experiences across the entire customer journey
In addition to using Intercom for support, Pitch’s Sales and Marketing teams are also leveraging features like Series, Product Tours, and Outbound Messages to engage prospects and customers throughout their journey with the product — from the first interaction through to them becoming a happy customer.
The Sales team is using Custom Bots to prompt website visitors to get in touch with sales if they’d like to learn more about Pitch’s paid plans.
Marketing uses Intercom to collect customer feedback and get a deeper understanding of their customers. By reaching out to target groups of customers with surveys or to schedule research interviews, the team is able to gauge customer sentiment, get real-time feedback about specific product areas, and identify opportunities for improvement. They also use Product Tours to educate customers about the product, which has been really helpful in getting customers set up for success from the get-go.
Verena says that having a single platform for customer communications is very beneficial when it comes to cross-functional collaboration. “Our support and sales email addresses route to Intercom, which allows us to use transfer macros to send conversations between the teams so sales can follow up on a revenue opportunity, or my team can help a customer with a product question,” says Verena. Making a lasting impact
Since implementing Intercom, Pitch has seen impressive results in its ability to scale its customer communications without losing the personal touch. ""I track a lot of numbers. And one thing I pay attention to is the number of support requests versus the number of help center visitors. It's really fascinating to see how many potential questions we're able to deflect by using the help center,” says Verena. “When I started looking at this at the beginning of last year, one in every five people would reach out to my team, and the other four would be able to self-serve. Now, only one in 12 is reaching out to my team, which saves us so much time. It gives us so much capacity back.""
With over 70% of customer queries coming in through the Messenger and a CSAT score that consistently sits at 100%, it’s obvious that Pitch’s customers are happy with the experiences the team is able to create through Intercom. Verena highlights how the platform has helped them to unlock growth opportunities and effectively scale their support without having to sacrifice this experience, which is so important to the team. Planning for the future
Verena and the team at Pitch are excited about the opportunity that lies ahead with Intercom. ""It was important to me that we had room to grow with Intercom when we started out,” Verena says. “We're not using all of the features available to us yet, but we wanted a product that we could grow into as we expand our team and business.""
With plans to further invest in proactive and self-serve support, Pitch is focused on driving increased efficiency, maximizing their impact, and continuing to create the best possible experiences for their customers at scale to boost satisfaction — and, ultimately, retention.

Qonto achieves 95% CSAT while growing its customer base at pace,"All-in-one finance management solution Qonto is on a mission to simplify the way businesses manage their finances. Having previously used a ticketing system for their customer support, the team wanted to adopt a more conversational approach in order to provide personal support at scale and build lasting relationships with their customers.
To do that, Qonto turned to Intercom to power their customer communication. The team is committed to ensuring that their 200,000 customers have a seamless experience using the Qonto product. On the operations team – under which customer support sits – there are 50 customer success officers and managers focused on improving operational efficiency across the business and setting their customers up for success. The opportunities for improvement
When Qonto began its search for a solution that would meet the needs of both the team and its customers, Martin Bouvier, Head of Onboarding, explains that there were a number of opportunities they wanted to seize:
Unlocking the ability to scale their support.
Improving customer communication.
Enhancing self-serve capabilities to make getting support an easier process for customers.
Improving UX and giving the team better visibility over the customer journey.
Offering multi-channel support while also reducing the number of tools used across the company to eliminate silos between teams. The team was in search of a modern solution that was more closely aligned with Qonto’s values and ways of working. What they liked about Intercom was its ability to combine powerful elements of conversational support and customer engagement to create a seamless, holistic customer communication experience in a single platform. “We made the switch to Intercom for a number of reasons: the assignment system and UX from a nurture perspective are better, it’s a dynamic platform that’s consistently adding new features, and we’re a fast-growing company, so we wanted to have a partner that had the same growth mindset,” he says. Driving results across support and engagement
Since implementing Intercom, the team has seen some impressive results, including reducing the median first-response time to just two minutes, driving faster resolutions for their customers, and saving up to 1,058 hours of team time each quarter. Intercom has also enabled them to provide more personal, efficient support experiences for their customers, helping them to maintain a customer satisfaction score of 95%. On the engagement side, the team has the ability to onboard customers faster, create a better nurture experience for them, and provide helpful documentation exactly when it’s needed. “With email, onboarding and engaging with customers can be a lot more complex – if things need to be re-sent, it can take a lot of time and slow down the process. Email is also a far less human experience. With Intercom, you’re closer to your customers and can get things done faster,” Martin says. Ongoing education
The team uses Product Tours and Mobile Carousels to create personalized walkthroughs of the Qonto platform for new and existing customers. When a new feature is launched, these tailored tours provide customers with the product education they need to be set up for success – with the added benefit of bringing them through the workflow and having them try it out for themselves. “Being able to help our customers understand all that Qonto can do is becoming increasingly important as we build and add more and more features to our product. Product Tours are really helpful in ensuring that clients benefit fully from Qonto's product,” says Martin. Providing personal, efficient support
With the Intercom Messenger integrated with the Qonto platform, customers can easily get in touch with the team, access help center articles, or ask Qonto’s custom-built Resolution Bot for help with an issue directly from their interface. Intercom is helping the team to maintain their impressive median first-response time of two minutes. It also enables them to resolve queries almost instantly and be better set up to answer questions that need a human touch with the enriched customer data that the platform provides. This not only results in a better experience for their customers, but also for the team, with customer success officers now able to work more efficiently and spend more time focusing on complex customer questions. Leveraging proactive and self-serve support
Qonto leverages proactive support capabilities in Intercom, such as Banners and Outbound Messages, to let customers know when temporary issues or outages arise and that they’re working on them – before the customers need to reach out for support. This has helped to drive down conversation volumes when temporary issues arise, and to free up team time to focus on customer queries that urgently need their attention.
The team also uses self-serve support features like Resolution Bot, Custom Bots, and Articles to offer personalized support at scale. Their Resolution Bot – called “Moshi” – is known to their customers by name, which attests to the strong relationships Intercom enables the Qonto team to build with their customers across all pillars of their support. Currently, Moshi is helping to resolve 10% of all inbound queries automatically and save 1,058 hours every quarter, resulting in increased team efficiency and an improved customer experience. Looking ahead, the team has plans to further expand its use of Resolution Bot with the goal of having it answer up to 30% of common questions coming in through the Messenger. Qonto uses Intercom’s Articles product to host their help center, enabling them to easily create and serve up relevant help documentation to customers so they can self-serve answers to their questions. “We like that customers are able to access FAQs directly through the Intercom Messenger in our product and can expand the articles in the same window if they need to. It feels like a more integrated experience,” says Martin. Cross-functional collaboration
The support team at Qonto makes it a priority to work closely with other teams from across the company to ensure the voice of the customer is championed throughout and that every team is aware of customers’ pain points and needs. All teams in Qonto are encouraged to use Intercom to analyze customer interactions and access valuable conversation history to help them solve problems and improve the customer experience. With the ability to tag and categorize conversations within Intercom, the product team can easily be notified as to how many customers are writing to the support team about specific topics. This helps them identify where there’s an issue that needs to be fixed. When it comes to planning the product roadmap, they have found immense value in being able to jump into Intercom and view chat history with customers to assess their needs and any feature requests they've logged. Intercom has also been helpful for Qonto’s rating teams, which are responsible for monitoring Qonto’s presence on rating and review sites. Through Intercom, the rating teams can follow up with customers who are unhappy or who have left a mixed review in order to better understand what has happened and how they can improve. When it comes to collaborating, having all customer communication consolidated in one platform enables Qonto to maximize impact. Martin explains, “We wanted to have the product, marketing, tech, and support teams working more closely together to ensure we remain truly customer-centric and fully aware of our clients' preferences and needs."" Best-in-class results
Since implementing Intercom, Qonto has seen very positive results across their customer support, engagement, and overall communication. On the engagement side, the team is now able to onboard customers faster and create better nurture experiences for them. When it comes to support, they’ve been able to drop their median first-response time to just two minutes – while still managing 15,000 conversations across their support channels each week. The team’s CSAT currently sits at an impressive 95%. “We’re constantly working on delivering the best possible client experience, and Moshi has helped a lot in that respect because it’s enabled the team to have more time to focus on complex queries requiring deeper support,” says Martin. “Across all of the teams that use Intercom, the main benefit is being able to get closer to our customers through chat. We can solve their problem from beginning to end in a short period of time through a fluid conversation.”"
Miss Group manages over a million customer conversations and keeps first-response time under 5 minutes with Intercom,"Challenge
Miss Group is an international web hosting group that consists of more than 20 different companies, offering a range of hosting-related services such as domain registration, SEO tools, web security, and more. With such a broad range of service offerings, the team was looking to streamline customer communications and provide the same level of service across all of their companies. They went in search of an out-of-the-box solution that would enable better cross-brand collaboration and give them a holistic view of their support, sales, and marketing messaging.
With Miss Group’s 20 companies using a number of other tools across their tech stacks, the team was keen to find a platform that could easily integrate with their existing infrastructure and be interoperable with tools that they may adopt in the future. Above all, they wanted to ensure that customer support and engagement were streamlined and efficient at every stage of the lifecycle, while also remaining personal. Solution
With Intercom, Miss Group has been able to set up individual workspaces for each of its companies and house them on a single, unified platform. “Having all of our brands working in the same tool makes it easy for me to have an overview of our different workspaces and customize each one to fit that specific brand’s needs,” says Anders Gustavsson, Chief Support Officer at Miss Group. “That alone has been a real time saver.” By leveraging a cohesive solution for customer messaging, Miss Group has been able to create a strong, consistent customer experience at every touchpoint. “We needed an easy-to-use platform that could stretch to meet all of our needs, and that’s what we got with Intercom,” says Anders. “All of the add-ons and integrations that Intercom offers make it seamless for us to customize the platform and empower us to create great customer experiences and constantly evolve our service.” Powering efficient support with live chat
Prior to using Intercom, many of the companies acquired by Miss Group were leveraging a combination of phone and email support to power their customer support. Since making the switch to chat with the Intercom Messenger, Miss Group’s Support teams are able to resolve customer queries much more quickly and manage multiple conversations at once, which has resulted in increased customer satisfaction. With all customer support communications being managed in a single platform, Miss Group can easily track core KPIs across all of its brands to ensure customers are getting the best possible experience. If certain brands are experiencing a temporary surge in conversation volume, Anders explains that support representatives are able to jump right into those workspaces and help out, given that they’re already familiar with the platform. Championing stand-out support as a competitive advantage and a lever for growth
The fact that Intercom empowers Miss Group’s Support teams to provide customers with fast responses and resolutions is one of the company’s unique selling points and gives them a significant competitive advantage. The Support teams partner closely with the Sales teams to ensure that any leads that get in touch via the Messenger are directed to the right teammate to nurture them through the sales cycle – and drive business growth. When new brands are acquired by Miss Group, it’s of the utmost importance to the team that new customers are made aware of the high-quality support now available if they need help with a query. “Intercom is a sign of quality, and we’re proud to be able to provide the level of support that we do for our customers,” says Anders. The team sends Outbound Messages to new customers via Intercom to notify them of their 24/7 chat support offering, resulting in an excellent customer experience from day one. Planning for the future
Since implementing Intercom, Miss Group has been able to boost efficiency, drive results across the business, and delight customers at every touchpoint. Looking ahead, the team plans to leverage even more of the Intercom platform – and is excited about trying some of the new innovations that are soon to be launched – so they can continue creating stand-out customer experiences. “Intercom has helped our company immensely as it’s allowed us to streamline the customer experience across our 20 brands,” says Anders. “The general consensus on our teams is that Intercom is highly intuitive and gets the job done. We’re now looking forward to the new Tickets feature, which will help us take our customer support to the next level.”"
"Living Spaces uses Intercom to create a unified customer experience across sales, support, and marketing","As a leader in the home furnishings industry, Living Spaces has long prided itself on providing best-in-class shopping experiences for its customers. Now with the accelerated move towards a digital-first economy, the team is using Intercom to bring the in-store experience they’ve carefully cultivated over the course of almost two decades, online. Amid the changes the retail industry has experienced as a result of COVID-19, the increasing demand for online shopping has also resulted in a rise and shift in customer expectations. When shopping online, customers expect the same personal experience they’re used to receiving in stores. In order to meet – and exceed – these growing expectations, the Living Spaces team decided to go all in on a conversational approach to supporting and engaging their customers, which is why they use Intercom across their marketing, sales, and support to create a unified customer experience. Having traditionally fostered a culture among their 2,000-strong team of building in-person relationships with customers, the Living Spaces team wanted to find a way of replicating that online. “Intercom has allowed us to finally unite our e-commerce and in-store experiences,” says Pete Franco, VP of E-commerce at Living Spaces, explaining that his team is committed to ensuring their customers receive the same level of care and attention, whether they’re shopping in a physical store or browsing the Living Spaces website. Balancing efficiency with a personal touch
Pete explains that the team leverages the full power of Intercom to balance efficient, automated support and engagement with a personal touch. Using proactive support to get ahead of known issues and frequently asked questions, sophisticated automation to create a seamless user journey, and a Business Messenger that allows them to have personal, real-time conversations with their website visitors and customers, they’re truly embodying Intercom’s mission of making internet business personal. “Our sales, support, and e-commerce teams are now on a single platform, greatly improving our overall customer experience and team efficiency,” Pete says. In having one platform for all customer communications, the team can get a clear picture of their end-to-end customer journey, giving them the freedom and flexibility to experiment with their outbound messaging and optimize based on what best suits their customers. Understanding customer needs
Given the wide selection of products Living Spaces offers, Pete explains that both their customers and their needs are incredibly broad-ranging. It’s important that the team understands what those needs are, and which stage of the buying journey customers are at when they’re speaking with them. Much like Intercom, Living Spaces sees relationships with their customers as ongoing conversations – not as once-off interactions that begin and end with a purchase. The Living Spaces team is focused on helping their customers throughout their lifecycle journey with the company, from the moment they first visit the website, through to delivery, and beyond. As Pete says: 
“We’re very focused on the experience of our customers. Naturally, buying bigger-ticket items is a big decision, and it can be complicated. A lot of our customers are buying before they move, trying to time things with moving out and moving in – there’s a lot that goes into the buying experience, and we want to make that as stress-free as possible.” When shopping in one of Living Spaces’ stores, customers have the option to speak with a member of their team and get expert advice to help them along their buying journey. Pete explains, “The relationships customers have with our associates in the stores are great, but when you go online, you’re left to do it on your own. When customers ask for help in the store, someone’s there 15 seconds later, and with Intercom, we’re trying to provide that same experience online.” Adopting a messenger-based approach to customer support
Thinking about the team’s journey with customer support, Pete nods to the culture shift they’ve undergone since going all in on a messenger-based approach, saying, “Since switching to Intercom, we’ve gone from saying ‘We hope they don’t need to contact us’ and ‘We hope that everything works out,’ to ‘Let’s get out there and send them messages,’ and we know we can efficiently respond to their replies, which is something we couldn’t do with phone calls. We much prefer chat.” Pete explains that the team’s average first response time through Intercom is under one minute – something that would not previously have been possible using phone and email support. This huge culture shift and move towards proactively supporting and engaging their customers is something the team is focused on building out even further in the months and years ahead.  Offering help before it’s needed
By leveraging proactive support to get ahead of known issues and frequently asked questions, support teams are afforded more time to deal with more sensitive or urgent customer queries. At Living Spaces, proactive support is a big focus for the team – they want to be able to help customers and resolve their problems before they ever need to contact support. When it comes to deliveries, for example, Pete explains that by collecting information such as the dimensions of a customer’s front door, the team can be proactive in letting them know which products will and won’t fit through it – and avoid a situation where that’s discovered at the point of delivery. In addition to making the team more efficient, Pete speaks to the positive impact proactive support has on their customers’ satisfaction levels, noting that the sooner in advance that they can help their customers, the better their experience is going to be. “Proactive support is really the big thing, and we’re only getting started. We’re going down that path and it’s not something small – it’s a complete culture change,” says Pete. Answering questions in-context
Using one of Intercom’s Custom Bots – which the team calls “Triage Bot” – Living Spaces can collect valuable information about their customers’ queries to have to hand when they’re speaking with them. By collecting details such as order numbers, they can ensure that customers are routed to the best person or team to help them with their question based on the products they’ve purchased or the status of their order, in order to be able to provide more efficient, in-context support. Championing customer and employee satisfaction
Of the many benefits the team has seen since they started using Intercom, one that stands out to Pete is the reaction their employees have had to being able to chat with customers through the Messenger. Having implemented in-store kiosks where staff members can jump into conversations in the Intercom Inbox, Pete notes that it’s had a very positive effect on employee satisfaction and engagement. “With Intercom, our retail team feels like they’re more ingrained in the broader company. For half of their day they can be selling on the floor, and the other half they’re helping customers online through Intercom,” Pete explains. This gives Living Spaces’ staff the opportunity to learn more about what their customers really need, and build relationships with them through the Messenger that they can then continue in their stores. Managing close to 8,000 weekly conversations, Pete explains that anywhere from 50 to 100 members of staff are on hand every day to handle inbound chats. Driving collaboration
Internally, the widespread adoption of Intercom means that teams are able to easily and seamlessly collaborate. Pete explains that teams from across the organization have gotten a great deal of value from being able to interact with customers and really understand their needs and pain points, with the product team regularly searching conversations for product feedback and being able to act quickly on those insights. Looking ahead, the Living Spaces team has plans to further scale their use of the Intercom platform to support their fast-growing business across sales, support, and marketing. “Intercom is a powerful tool for companies focused on growth and efficiency,"" Pete says.

Nuuly achieves 96% CSAT and saves over 50 hours of team time per month with Intercom,"Owned by Urban Outfitters Inc., Nuuly is a curated fashion destination for anyone who loves fashion and is exploring how to wear, buy, and sell it in ways that are gentler on the planet and their wallets. Shoppers can do this through both of its services: Nuuly Rent, a monthly rental subscription platform, and Nuuly Thrift, a peer-to-peer resale platform.
The Nuuly team launched its first venture, Nuuly Rent, in mid-2019, just six months before the pandemic hit. Nuuly Rent gives shoppers access to a rotating wardrobe with pieces from over 300 brands, including Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, and Free People. Natalie Hurst, Director of Customer Support at Nuuly, explains that they needed to be able to communicate with customers quickly and in a personal, empathetic way as they navigated the logistical challenges that ensued.
A key benefit of Intercom, she says, was its ability to enable highly personalized support at scale. The team has since expanded its use of the platform to provide support to customers of Nuuly Thrift, which launched in late 2021. Across both services, Natalie’s team is very focused on building lasting relationships with their customers, which Intercom’s customer communications platform allows them to do. Being adaptable to meet customer needs
With the unpredictability Nuuly Rent faced in its first year, the team needed to quickly adapt to the changing retail landscape so they could continue providing the best possible service for their customers. “Once COVID hit, the question was, how do we act? Not only in a way that makes sense for the business, but being really empathetic to our customers,” says Natalie. “I saw retailers who said, ‘Sorry, you can't return. Sorry, we're not going to be flexible,’ and that was 100% the approach we did not want to take.” Championing their ethos of putting the customer first, the product team built functionality to pause subscriptions in the app in order to meet their customers’ changing needs. Intercom played a pivotal role in enabling the team to communicate these important updates and keep a pulse on customer satisfaction in an unobtrusive way, which Natalie notes has been critical. Leveraging bots and automation to power support at scale
With inbound conversation volume on the rise, the team leaned on Intercom’s automation capabilities to make their support more efficient. They used tags in Intercom to identify recurring trends in the types of questions the support team was receiving and implemented a custom-built Resolution Bot – which they call “Chat Cat” – to help resolve these frequently-asked questions. Natalie highlights that both Chat Cat and the automation Intercom enables behind the scenes have been extremely helpful when conversation numbers are spiking – especially due to specific issues, such as shipping delays. Since implementing Chat Cat, Nuuly has seen improvements in a number of key areas across their support:
Thanks to Chat Cat’s instant answers, customers aren’t left waiting for responses to easy-to-answer questions.
The bot directs customers to self-serve resources so they can seek answers to their own questions. If a question needs to be escalated, it can direct the customer to the support team for further help.
With Chat Cat resolving a whopping 27.4% of inbound conversations, the support team can be freed up to deal with more complex queries.
“Our customers are paying to have their goods for a month, so they want their goods for a month. If there's a 12-day shipping delay, that's not a great experience,” says Natalie. “We have a really great automation tool in Chat Cat. If a customer writes to us about an undelivered package, the bot responds letting them know that if it hasn’t arrived in two days, it will escalate the issue to the support team, which does help a lot."" Championing customer satisfaction
When it comes to measuring success, Nuuly’s North Star is customer satisfaction. While the team does track individual performance metrics, such as the number of conversations handled per day, Natalie notes that the highest priority is placed on customer happiness. “Reporting is really important, particularly when it comes to satisfaction rating,” she says, which is evident from the team’s high CSAT scores, which consistently sit at an impressive 96%. Nuuly is committed to creating delightful experiences for customers throughout their entire journey with the service. They focus on forging lasting relationships with their customers and helping them to maximize their subscription through ongoing engagement. “I want our team to be very much focused on building relationships with our customers, versus having transactional interactions,” says Natalie. Driving bottom-line results
When it comes to tracking team performance and impact, Natalie highlights the incredible productivity her team is able to achieve using Intercom, with associates handling up to a staggering 120 conversations per day and resolving queries in just over two and a half hours. Speaking to the role Intercom plays in achieving these stellar results, Hillary Scholz, Customer Success Associate at Nuuly, says, “Intercom makes it simple to work through conversations quickly by having all customer information readily available. Being able to sort conversations based on wait time allows for a swift and seamless experience for both our team and the customer!”
In addition to traditional support metrics, Natalie also stresses the importance of measuring the impact of great customer support on bottom-line business metrics like customer retention. “Our business is subscription-based, so we want our customers to come back every single month,” she says. “So how can we, from a customer success perspective, help to retain those customers?”
For Natalie, this boils down to:
The strong, consistent experiences her team is creating for their customers through Intercom. For example, the team has used Outbound Messages to reach out to their customer base during difficult times, such as the California fires or flooding in Louisiana, to let them know that they’re going to pause their account and will be there when customers are ready to resume their subscription.
Driving ongoing engagement with customers through their “styling services” offering. Customers can fill out a form on Nuuly’s website and that data feeds into Intercom where Natalie’s team can build personalized presentations for customers to help them maximize their subscription. Having a platform that enables them to have fluid conversations with customers is a crucial element of this service and helps them to build relationships that result in higher satisfaction – and retention, as a result. A unified platform for customer communication
Intercom provides Nuuly with a huge amount of valuable customer data in a single platform, which is a big efficiency gain for the team. With everything living in one place, support associates can save time that would have otherwise been spent switching between various tools to gather context needed to resolve a customer’s issue. Having a single source of truth for customer communication is also a great advantage when it comes to cross-functional collaboration at Nuuly. The support team can quickly tag teammates from across the company in conversations, helping to eliminate silos and increase visibility of the types of issues customers are experiencing. This enables them to spot recurring trends in conversations and leverage customer feedback to inform product development. Natalie points to the notes feature in Intercom as being pivotal in their ability to collaborate with other teams and ensure they’re providing fast resolutions – and great experiences – for their customers. Measuring success
Nuuly’s support operation is distributed across multiple locations, so Intercom’s ease of use is hugely important. It enables them to onboard new hires quickly and seamlessly, leading to better collaboration and increased efficiency. These time-saving advantages are crucial for empowering the team to do their best work – and keep customers happy. Nuuly’s sky-high CSAT scores alone speak to the impact that an easy-to-use communications platform can have on the customer experience. When it comes to powering support at scale, the bots and automation capabilities Intercom provides are helping the team to drive business results. Chat Cat is currently resolving 27.4% of the 12,000 conversations they receive every month, which equates to just over 50 hours of support team time saved. This enables Natalie’s team to increase their impact – without having to dramatically increase headcount. Focusing on growth
“There's a lot of opportunity for growth with Intercom that I'm really excited for as our team continues to grow,” says Natalie. With the impressive results the team saw using Intercom for Nuuly Rent, they expanded their use of the platform to provide support for customers of their most recent venture, Nuuly Thrift. Having a single communications platform enables the team to create consistent customer experiences across both of these services, which is critical. ""We want customers to feel like they're part of a community with the Nuuly experience,” says Natalie. “That's one of the reasons we created Nuuly Thrift – not only are you renting clothing through Nuuly Rent, you can also resell and recycle clothes that have been sitting in your closet. It's a full circle now, and we want it to be a unified experience.” With ambitious goals for the year ahead, they’re focused on building out their use of Intercom across the entire business to keep producing strong results and consistent customer experiences as they scale. From driving further improvements in SLAs to enhancing their self-serve support experience, Nuuly will continue to partner closely with Intercom to deliver ongoing support and engagement and build lasting relationships with their customers. “We're anticipating a lot of growth again this year, so having the ability to easily onboard our associates, create great experiences for our customers, and measure our impact with detailed reporting all in one platform is huge.”"
Ideris uses Intercom to create stellar experiences throughout the customer journey,"Challenge
Brazilian e-commerce integration solution Ideris's previous support tool wasn't proving to be a fit for its team or customers' needs. On the very same day it was implemented, the team received complaints from customers that their conversations weren’t being responded to – and the Support team reported that chats weren’t being received.
To solve this, Ideris needed to find a support tool that would inspire trust in both its Support team and customers. The team wanted a platform that would enable them to work efficiently and provide stellar support. Having worked with Intercom in the past, they knew it had the solutions they were looking for. Solution
Thanks to Intercom, Ideris is confident that it's creating high-touch, stand-out experiences for customers throughout their journey with the platform.
Providing personal, efficient support
The Intercom Messenger is Ideris’s primary support channel for customer queries. Speaking to the team's decision to implement Intercom to support their customers, Rodrigo Moro, Business Intelligence Coordinator at Ideris, says, ""We really like Intercom's UI and we know that it provides an outstanding experience for our customers, which we feel pretty great about. It's as simple as that!""
The team leverages Articles to host a robust help center and empower customers to self-serve answers to their own queries. Before using Intercom, Ideris's help center was receiving up to 500 visits per month. Since implementing Intercom, it's receiving more than 5,000 visits every month – a 90% increase. This enables many customers to fully resolve their issues without the need for extra help from the team. In fact, with Intercom's help, Ideris has increased its self-serve support rate by 17%, freeing up the Support team’s time to focus on more complex or urgent queries. Connecting with customers at every touchpoint
To enhance the customer onboarding experience, Ideris uses Product Tours to give new users a walkthrough of the platform and quickly bring them up to speed. The team also leverages Intercom’s outbound messaging capabilities to connect with users throughout their journey with the Ideris platform.
They use Intercom's visual campaign builder, Series, to check in on customers during onboarding, proactively survey customers to gauge sentiment and satisfaction, and collect feedback to ensure they're creating the most seamless and personalized experience possible. As a growing business, Ideris can adapt to meet the changing needs of its customers with Intercom. As a platform the team can grow into as it needs to, they can adopt more of its features and capabilities as needs arise. Having started out just using Intercom to support customers through live chat, Ideris has since expanded to leverage other features to explore new and innovative ways of engaging with their customers. The team also leverages the Intercom API to connect other tools in their tech stack, enabling them to create consistent experiences for customers – and streamline workflows for support reps."
Otus drives 97% CSAT and resolves over 22% of customer queries automatically with Intercom,"Challenge
EdTech platform Otus previously used email to engage with and support its customers, but found it limiting as it didn’t enable in-app communications. As the team grew, they needed a unified platform that would act as a single source of truth for all customer communications, which email also didn’t provide.
They sought a flexible, omnichannel solution that would enable them to meet customers where they are, create stellar experiences across the user journey, and provide robust reporting so they could optimize communications, boost customer satisfaction, and drive business growth. As a company built for teachers, by teachers, a core focus for the Otus team is designing technology to save its customers time. The team wanted to ensure that their communications platform mirrored this focus, making it easy for customers to contact the team in a quick and seamless way. ""Many of us at Otus are former educators, and we know just how little time teachers have to spend on technology,"" says Samantha Mason, Director of Client Success at Otus. ""That's why it was important to us that our communications solution could streamline our efforts and save our customers time. The less time teachers spend with us, the more time they have to spend on what truly matters, which is connecting with their students."" Solution
Having started out using Intercom for live chat, Otus has expanded its use of the platform to power customer support, engagement, and acquisition and serve as a single home for all communications. They combine proactive and real-time messaging to create best-in-class experiences for their customers. A one-stop shop for customer messaging
With a unified platform for customer communication, Otus is empowered to create consistent experiences, collaborate more effectively, and drive continuous improvement by leveraging Intercom’s analytics – specifically, Conversation Topics and Custom Reports – to understand their customers’ needs and celebrate their team’s success.
Here's how the team leverages all of Intercom's features to support, connect with, and acquire customers.
Support: Otus has customized the Intercom Inbox to streamline its support and manage the Support team’s workload. The team leverages automation features like Custom Bots and Articles to offer customers instant answers in real time and empower them to self-serve. With the help of bots and automation, Otus is resolving 22.2% of its customers questions automatically – and with a CSAT score of 97%, it's evident that customers are happy with the fast, personal service they're receiving.
Engage: The team leverages Intercom for mass communications across marketing and product announcements, which allows them to provide customers with the education they need to be set up for success. They use Product Tours, along with post messages and emails, to proactively communicate with customers during onboarding and notify them when new products or services are being launched. They can also closely monitor engagement rates and find areas of opportunity to optimize their communications.
Convert: The Intercom Messenger greets visitors to Otus's website and seamlessly connects them with the Sales team so they can understand prospective customers' needs – and drive business growth. Building a tech stack for success
Otus also utilizes a number of Intercom's integrations to ensure the team's core tools and systems are in sync.
Salesforce: The Intercom and Salesforce integration gives Otus access to important information when working with customers.
Jira Service Desk: The team uses Jira to process their support tickets, and have integrated its service desk with the Intercom Inbox to ensure a seamless flow of updates for both customers and support reps.
Slack: Leads from Otus's website are sent to a dedicated Slack channel for the Sales team's attention. Creating best-in-class experiences at every touchpoint
“Thanks to Intercom and the support of their team, we’re able to offer a swift and seamless experience to our customers,"" says Samantha.

Frame.io uses Intercom to provide personalized support to 2M customers,"Frame.io is a cloud-based video collaboration platform that acts as a central hub for creators. The team has redefined the traditional model of video collaboration, boasting a customer list that includes the likes of Netflix, HBO, Google, and Masterclass.
Having experienced exponential growth in recent years, Brett Rush, Director of Customer Experience at Frame.io, explains that their customer base has grown more than 11 times in size since he joined the company in 2016. When Brett initially came on board as Head of Support, Frame.io’s CEO, Emery Wells, along with the CTO and Sales and Engineering department heads, were all on the frontlines of the company’s customer support. Since then, Brett and his team have developed a robust set of processes to streamline and scale their support in order to meet the needs of their growing customer base. With customer expectations at an all-time high, Intercom’s conversational support solution has enabled Frame.io to create strong, consistent support experiences and build lasting relationships with their customers. The team is now providing support for a whopping two million customers and managing 4,500 conversations each month. Building a tech stack for success 
Having previously used Help Scout and Zendesk, Brett explains that neither platform provided them with the all-in-one solution that they needed. The team used Help Scout primarily for hosting their knowledge base but found that the ticketing solution wasn’t suitable for their needs, and with Zendesk, Brett notes that the set-up process was tricky to navigate. “We had difficulties with Zendesk not being a plug-and-play solution. Design and engineering resources are needed to get set up. Intercom was easy to configure and implement while offering the ability to provide conversational support,” he says.  Intercom’s conversational approach to customer experience was one of the standout features to the team, explains Frame.io’s CEO Emery Wells. “Intercom is an easy choice. It’s a platform with a combination of products that’s truly unique and accomplishes multiple jobs around customer communication,” he says. “At the highest level, that was the biggest differentiating point for us.”
From tickets to conversations 
Over the past year, one of the team’s goals has been to make their support more conversational, rather than it feeling like a ticketing system. Leveraging a combination of Intercom’s proactive, self-serve, and human support capabilities, they’ve been able to make great progress in pursuit of this goal, creating personalized experiences for customers at scale through conversations. And the results speak for themselves. In the last year, the team’s first-response time has been reduced from 3 hours to just 15 minutes – an 87.5% reduction. Gill Wiggins, a manager on the support team at Frame.io, points to bots and automation as key contributors to the team’s success in boosting efficiency across their support. With such a large customer base, scaling personalized support to reach every customer can be a difficult feat, but with Intercom, they’ve been able to strike the right balance between being personal and efficient. “We sometimes forget that there is such a big gap between the number of support reps we have on the team and the number of customers we’re supporting because our KPIs are consistently high. Intercom has really helped us to bridge that gap – it almost acted as another rep at times,” she says. 
Empowering customers to help themselves
Through self-serve support features in Intercom, Frame.io’s customers have been empowered to search for information and find answers to their own questions. Pointing to the trends they’re seeing in customer appetite for these self-serve support journeys, Brett says, “We have over 20,000 help center visits and 36,000 article views every month. Our customers are really focused on trying to find the answer to their question first, or at least explore a solution before trying to reach out to our team.”  In an effort to free up the team’s time and avoid the drain that comes with having to consistently answer the same questions, Gill and team implemented a custom bot flow to help resolve some of their most frequently asked questions. “We’re constantly tweaking the wording in the bot flows and customizing it to our style to ensure our customers aren’t having to read the same thing over and over, but the Custom Bots have been so helpful in freeing up our team’s time and ensuring that our users are getting a response in a timely manner. It makes it feel like we have another person on the team, which has really helped.”  Proactively meeting customer needs  
The Frame.io team leverages proactive support to alert customers when a temporary issue arises, as well as to understand common sticking points within the product where the team has an opportunity to provide some additional support or education. Intercom enables the team to have a direct line of communication with customers, keep them updated, and manage the conversation volume that’s reaching the support team so they don’t become overwhelmed with inbound queries.  Brett explains that the team is also utilizing conversation tags to analyze recurring trends and identify where customers are running into issues or tend to have questions, saying, “Intercom has really helped us turn our conversations into data. As my team hears all too often from me, data speaks volumes. If we’re not tracking what our customers need or are looking for, it’s going to be so difficult to understand that customer’s story and be able to relay that back to the rest of the company.”  Balancing the workload
When it comes to managing inbound conversation volume, the team has implemented Intercom's workload management feature, which automatically assigns inbound conversations to ensure that no agent has more than five conversations in their active queue. Gill explains that this has had a massive impact on the team, pointing to a few major benefits they’ve experienced since implementing it: 
The automatic distribution of inbound queries has helped to reduce queue anxiety for agents. 
New hires have been able to ramp up faster – by not having the ability to cherry pick questions to answer, the team members are getting exposure to a broader range of topics. 
Keeping inbox queues at a manageable level has had a great impact on team morale. 
“We tested workload management for a week and when we asked the team how they were feeling, it was a unanimous yes to keep it,” says Gill. “It was interesting because even though it was a busy week, they said it felt like a really quiet one. I think it’s made their day so much easier knowing that they can jump into a meeting and not come back to see that there’s been an explosion in their queue.” 
Seamless collaboration
Outside of support, Gill points to the benefits of having their Product and Sales teams able to jump into conversations in the Inbox and collaborate to reach faster resolutions. “It’s great when other teams are actively working in Intercom because we can mention them in a conversation and have them reply to us in there too,” she says.  This direct insight into what customers are writing to the support team has also proved to be very valuable in helping the Product team to analyze and prioritize customer requests. Using Zapier and Airtable, new feature requests received from customers can be automatically sent to Airtable for the team to consider adding to their roadmap. 
Making it easy to talk to customers
Customer communication is a core part of Frame.io’s business, with Brett explaining that all new hires are trained on how to use Intercom and encouraged to jump into conversations with customers from the get-go. The feedback the team has gotten from the onboarding program has been incredibly positive, with new hires pleasantly surprised at how easy Intercom makes it to speak directly with customers.  “All the time we hear feedback from folks that have never talked to a customer before, saying that they came in a little scared but it was actually very easy to have a conversation with the customer through the Inbox,” says Brett. “Intercom’s easy to use and allows you to feel comfortable talking to customers, which is great. It’s not like a ticketing system where all of a sudden you’re just bombarded with lots of tickets. I feel like it’s really different having a conversational platform.”
Looking to the future
As Frame.io continues to grow, Brett, Gill, and the team are focused on continuing to champion the voice of the customer throughout the company and ensuring that their needs are being met through personalized and efficient support. “Gill and Erin, another manager on our support team, are constantly staying abreast of new Intercom features and figuring out what we can do with them,” says Brett. Speaking to the impact Intercom has had on the business, he adds, “I think the results we’ve seen to date speak volumes to how Intercom has helped us to remain a tight-knit team and offer support at scale.” "
Code for America uses conversational support to show up with empathy for their clients,"Code for America is a non-profit group that has developed a suite of digital tools and services to help people apply for benefits in the US. The team sets out to work towards “a government for the people, by the people, that works in the digital age.” Above all else, the Code for America team believes in showing up with empathy for their clients, which is why they use Intercom’s Conversational Support solution to provide help at every stage of the application process. “We believe that government at all levels can and should work well for all people. Using insights and ideas from real people, we break down barriers to meet community needs and improve government in meaningful ways,” says Arlene Corbin Lewis, Chief Communications and Marketing Officer at Code for America. To do this, the team partners closely with local government to give people better access to public programs. They have developed a broad range of initiatives, including GetCalFresh and MNbenefits, to help people apply for a variety of benefits in the states of California and Minnesota.  Helping to put food on the table
In California, GetCalFresh assists residents with applying to CalFresh, the state’s version of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Through CalFresh, residents get monthly benefits that they can use to buy food for their household. Since 2019, GetCalFresh has helped more than six million people either access or maintain their SNAP benefits.  Prior to the onset of COVID-19, the Code for America team saw a weekly average of 3,000 conversations coming through the Intercom Messenger. Over the past 12 months, they’ve had to scale their efforts to support the 9,000 conversations they were receiving every week at the height of the pandemic – a 300% increase. Thanks to Intercom’s Inbox and bots, the team has been able to continue providing highly personal support despite the massive surge in conversation volume, using Resolution Bot to offer instant self-serve support and answer frequently asked questions through English, Spanish, and Cantonese. This lets the team maintain a fast response time for more urgent queries that need immediate attention from someone on the team. Striking the balance between efficient and personal support
At the same time, the team strives to balance efficient support and personal interaction. For instance, people often reach out to ask for their case number or get an update on their application. The team can quickly look up the information and provide updates through Intercom in a matter of seconds, saving people hours of time and enabling them to move on to the next stage of the process.  They also take the time to say something as simple as “I can see that your case is pending,” just to reassure clients that there is a person on the other side of the conversation ready to support them. “Knowing that there’s someone with you and on your side when you’re facing tough times can have such an impact,” says Arlene.   Fueling change through feedback
As the team discovered during the COVID-19 crisis, confusion around claiming benefits is a huge issue for people. This is driven largely by the fact that in certain states, government benefits are administered on a county-by-county basis, rather than at the state level, which makes finding the relevant resources and documentation a convoluted process.  Intercom enables the Code for America team to analyze client conversations and feed valuable insights back to the California Department of Social Services, which has oversight of CalFresh, so they can help move the needle on improving access to government benefits. “These feedback loops are helping to make more equitable outcomes possible,” explains Arlene.  “And by removing barriers like multiple phone calls, visits to the county office, or waiting in long lines to fill out paper applications, we’re meeting people’s needs at a deeper level of dignity and respect.”  Bridging the digital divide
Another initiative that the Code for America team has developed is MNbenefits, which assists Minnesotans with getting access to a number of the state’s public programs. The team has partnered closely with local government in Minnesota to improve the application process for nine different safety net benefits, including food assistance, cash programs, emergency assistance, housing support, and child care assistance.  Deirdre Hirschtritt, a Senior Qualitative Researcher at Code for America who works on the MNbenefits program, explains that the team uses Intercom to offer personal support to their clients as they’re guided through the application process. Before the introduction of MNbenefits, applying to the state’s benefit programs took over an hour. Now, thanks to the initiative, the application process has been reduced to just 12 minutes and the team has helped to process applications for 25,000 people. “Over the past year, our Integrated Benefits team has been working with the state of Minnesota to build a new integrated public benefits application,” Deirdre says. “Now, clients from several counties across the state can apply for multiple programs, all from one mobile-friendly website.”  Offering continued support 
Speaking to the impact Intercom has had on the team’s ability to support their clients, Deirdre says, “Intercom enables us to help our clients navigate the application process for benefits, to answer questions they might have, and then offer them support after they’ve completed the application. When people come back to our site, Intercom is their first point of contact to get in touch with us about their case status or how to take the next step in the enrollment process.”  This conversational approach to communicating with their clients is one of the main reasons the Code for America team chose Intercom to power their support. Through conversations, the team is able to learn more about their clients in order to adapt to help people in different situations. As Deirdre explains, “A staff member from a community-based organization recently got in touch with us through Intercom to ask for support for one of her clients. She asked about how to apply for a family in a specific situation – which our application didn’t yet support – and we were able to guide her client through the application process and then work with our product team to create the functionality to support families in similar situations in the future.”  The ability to have conversations through the Intercom Messenger has also created opportunities for the MNbenefits team to connect with local organizations and expand their program to support more people. “As a result of the conversational tone of our communication through chat, the staff member from the community-based organization and I learned more about each other’s work and made a plan to meet over Zoom to continue the conversation about how our team can better support her clients in the future,” Deirdre says.  Keeping clients connected 
Similar to the GetCalFresh program, Deirdre explains that the feedback loop Intercom enables between MNbenefits’ clients and their caseworkers is incredibly important to their team. “I think the most meaningful use of Intercom that we’ve had to date is the quick feedback loop it allows between clients who need help getting food on the table and caseworkers who can help process those applications. Just today we got a message from a client who had applied for SNAP months ago and hadn’t heard anything back about his eligibility. I was able to immediately contact his county and within the hour, a staff member had called the client to get him his benefits right then and there.” Making a difference
The important work that Code for America is doing across all of their programs continues to impact the lives of millions of people, working endlessly to bridge the digital divide between government benefits and assistance programs and the people who need them most. Speaking to the role Intercom plays in helping the team to continue this work, Deirdre says, “Our work falls into what’s called the social safety net – programs like SNAP and Medicaid are a way that we catch people who are struggling and offer some support. My colleague described Intercom as a sort of ‘safety net’ in itself. In a bureaucratic system where hour-long waits on phone lines are the norm, Intercom is a way for clients to connect with a human in real time.”  Check out the rest of our stories"
Appliances Online unified its digital and in-store experiences and generated $1M in ARR with Intercom,"Challenge
Founded by John Winning, Appliances Online is Australia’s largest online appliance retailer and the e-commerce arm of century-old, brick-and-mortar retailer Winning Appliances. Having always been known for providing exceptional in-store customer service, John Winning wanted to replicate that in a digital setting with Appliances Online and provide customers with the seamless shopping experiences they’ve long been used to receiving.
To do this, Appliances Online needed a robust and customizable platform that would enable them to communicate with customers in real-time. The team turned to Intercom to ensure that the customer service they pride themselves on could be unified with their online experience. Solution
Having started out using Intercom for live chat, Appliances Online has since expanded its use of the platform to provide its customers with ongoing engagement throughout their journey. 
Support: The team uses Intercom to offer real-time support. They leverage the platform’s reporting capabilities to maintain their minimum first-response time of 1.5 minutes and 80% CSAT. 
Engage: Intercom has enabled them to stay nimble as customer needs have evolved in recent years. During the height of Australia’s COVID-19 lockdown, they were able to provide updates to customers about changing rules and restrictions using Intercom’s Banners feature. 
Convert: The team uses the Intercom Messenger to drive increased on-site conversions – and business growth, as a result. This has enabled the team to convert 200% more leads through Intercom and generate a staggering $1 million in ARR.
Due to the brand’s impressive gains using Intercom, Winning expanded their use of the platform to five of their other e-commerce brands. Check out the rest of our stories"
Stuart is using Intercom to engage and proactively support their clients – at just the right time,"Owned by GeoPost, Stuart is the leading logistics platform in Europe, operating in more than 100 cities with over 3,500 clients and counting. Having previously used email and SMS to communicate with both their clients and couriers, the team at Stuart knew they needed a channel that was faster, more efficient, and more personal to help them onboard and support their customer base as they grew their presence across Europe. Stuart has over 100 agents on their support team to ensure a great experience for clients and couriers. Andrew Baylis, Head of Live Ops and Support, explains the present team size reflects the surge in growth they’ve seen in their user base over the last few years: Stuart now supports over 3,500 clients and 30,000 partner-couriers.
The team made the switch from Zendesk to Intercom because the level of support they needed to provide to their growing user base just wasn’t possible with email. Andrew says, “Hot food is one of several big industries for us, and sending an email when your meal is getting cold is not the right communication channel. We were looking for something far more effective, and that’s where we found Intercom.” Intercom’s outbound messaging gave them a faster, more flexible and reliable way to communicate with their clients. In addition to replacing email, the team was able to use outbound messaging in place of SMS – their previous channel of communication with partner-couriers – saving significant monthly costs. 
Going from strength to strength with Intercom
Stuart focuses on three main industries: grocery, retail, and food, and has recently expanded its product offering to include Stuart XL, a delivery service that works with companies like IKEA to offer home delivery and furniture building services to their customers. Another recent addition to their offering is Hub 2 Home, a retail-focused initiative that offers a delivery hub within major cities that stores can deliver orders to, and from which Stuart can fulfill the last part of the distribution. Intercom plays a critical role in keeping Stuart connected with their clients and partner-couriers across every vertical, helping them to effectively manage the tens of thousands of chats they receive every week. With Intercom’s Inbox integrated with Stuart’s CRM, the team can categorize incoming queries based on the stage of the delivery process they relate to and use assignment rules to route them to specialized agents rather than grouping all process issues together. This has led to a huge spike in efficiency with valuable seconds being shaved off every interaction, resulting in the team gaining over 88 hours of time back every week and agents being able to handle up to 90 chats per hour. Having originally used Intercom for marketing and customer success and building out to include support, Andrew explains, “Intercom has grown up a lot since we started using it, and we’ve evolved alongside it.”
Personal, proactive support – in a scalable way
With the change in eating and shopping habits resulting from Covid-19, Stuart saw a whopping 400% increase in grocery volumes due to the rise in business their clients were seeing. Now facilitating the delivery of thousands of packages every day, Stuart is proactively supporting its clients and drivers with Intercom, leveraging outbound messaging to get ahead of known issues like adverse weather conditions and public events that could affect delivery windows and remind partner-couriers of necessary checks they need to make during delivery. In the UK, for example, deliveries containing alcohol or dangerous goods such as knives need to adhere to the Challenge 25 rule, which states that partner-couriers need to check that any recipient appearing to be under the age of 25 is over the legal age of 18 before they can complete the delivery. Integrating Intercom with their clients’ apps and websites enables them to proactively remind partner-couriers to check ID, reducing any potential issues and enhancing their overall quality of service.
The team is also using self-serve support features like Custom Bots with sophisticated resolution and routing capabilities to help them triage incoming queries in a way that’s fast and efficient, but also personal. In a test with a UK pharmacy client, the team was able to use these bots to share relevant help center articles, which resolved 70% of customer queries through automation.
On the client side, Andrew notes that small, independent restaurants typically don’t have time to chat, so Intercom’s ability to give them live updates on the status of deliveries has been incredibly impactful during this time. A support tech stack built for success
To ensure they’re providing the right support – at just the right time – Stuart uses the Intercom API to integrate tools in its wider tech stack like Slack and Segment. Enabling these systems to talk to one another helps Stuart’s support team to have all the necessary context on-hand to understand each stage of the delivery lifecycle so they can provide timely, informed support to their drivers and clients, every step of the way. Data from Intercom is also analyzed by other teams within Stuart – from operations, to client and account management teams – to gain valuable insights on their overall client and partner-courier experience and identify areas that need to be optimized.
By integrating their data systems like Segment with Intercom, the team at Stuart is able to identify and reach out to customers based on their behavior on the platform. For example, by pulling their own CRM data into Intercom, Stuart can automate engagement campaigns to onboard partner-couriers and clients, congratulate partner-couriers on reaching key milestones, say, 5 or 10 completed deliveries, and much more. The ability to acknowledge their customers’ successes at scale and keep these communications personal is one of the many reasons Stuart uses Intercom. As the direct link between their clients and partner-couriers, Stuart also needs to be able to facilitate real-time communication between both sides of their user base – and with 3,500 clients and 30,000 drivers, that’s no easy feat. By integrating Intercom with Slack, the team has built a communication channel that permits their enterprise clients like Just Eat to get in touch with delivery drivers through a dedicated Slack channel. This integration allows the partner-couriers to receive messages directly within the Stuart driver app, and makes communication between parties easy and seamless.
End-to-end engagement
Outside of their support operation, Stuart’s marketing team also uses Intercom to engage people at every stage of the user journey. From acquisition and onboarding to loyalty campaigns, marketing is making the most of Intercom’s engagement products to maximize the experience of their clients and drivers, seeing goal completion results of 60% and higher for many of these engagement campaigns. The team is using UTM parameters to track conversions from ad campaigns on platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google, which they can match to client account data in Intercom to give them a clear picture of how their campaigns are performing and help them to understand more about their new clients. Once a user has signed up, the team uses Product Tours to walk them through how to download invoices, give feedback on deliveries, redeem coupons, or add multi-drops to a single delivery, and has successfully onboarded over 17,000 users to-date.
Support that feels 1:1 at all times
Above all else, Stuart uses Intercom to stay connected with their user base as they continue to grow, and build strong relationships with the new clients and drivers that join them along the way. With such a large and fast-paced operation, keeping communication personal can be difficult. But with Intercom, the team can maintain those personal conversations even as they grow. Andrew fondly recalls getting messages from users through the Business Messenger, saying, “One of our drivers in Barcelona used to message us every day saying ‘Hope you have a blessed day’ – which was something we never got with email. Intercom made our communication far more friendly and personal.”"
Spendesk decreased their first-response time by 80% in six months,"With a mission to “help businesses spend smarter,” Spendesk uses Intercom across sales, support, and marketing to provide their customers with the help and support they need to efficiently manage their finances. Vincent Terol, Spendesk’s Head of Customer Success, explains that the company’s mission is to make business spending easy with their all-in-one spend management platform. “Our value promise is to give visibility and control to finance teams and make expenses an easy process for employees,” he says. “Customer support is a top priority of ours, we want to ensure that our customers are maximizing their use of the platform and be there to help them on that journey.” With 55,000 users and counting, the Spendesk team uses Intercom to create strong user experiences across the entire customer lifecycle. A single source of truth for customer conversations
Prior to using Intercom, the team used Zendesk for customer support. On the recommendation of their investors, they implemented Intercom to take a more conversational approach to supporting their customers, while still using Zendesk to host their help center. In 2020, the team made the decision to consolidate all of their customer communication and support documentation into a single platform, migrating the help center from Zendesk and adopting Intercom as their sole support platform. “Before using Intercom, we didn’t have a single source of truth for customer contact, which is what we wanted,” says Vincent. “A key value differentiator of Intercom compared with Zendesk was its ability to offer proactive and self-serve support capabilities.” The team wanted to be able to communicate more effectively with customers and offer them help when they needed it, which Intercom enabled them to do. Having started out using the platform solely for customer support, the team gradually expanded their use of the product. They now also leverage Intercom’s Conversational Marketing and Customer Engagement solutions to power their sales and marketing. Providing powerful human support with automation
Victoria Vergnaud is on the Customer Success Operations team at Spendesk, driving the use of powerful automation and bots across the customer success and user care teams. Using a combination of Custom Bots and Resolution Bot, Victoria explains that customer queries are effectively triaged and routed to the right person to help them with their issue. This not only enhances efficiency within the support org, it also creates better experiences for their customers. “Intercom’s proactive and self-serve support capabilities are really powerful for us on the customer success and care teams,” she says. “They’ve enabled us to maintain a customer contact rate of 7%. We’re also using features like Series to be more personalized in our approach to messaging our customers, which has been hugely beneficial for us.” Providing support at scale with bots
As Spendesk continues to grow, Victoria explains that their expanding customer base has resulted in a surge of activity across their sales, support, and marketing operations. On the support side, Intercom’s bots have been invaluable in helping the teams to manage this increase in inbound conversation volume. Custom Bots are currently triaging all 1,500 monthly inbound conversations and Resolution Bot is resolving one in every five common questions that it’s answering. “Our customer base has steadily increased in the last year, and both Resolution Bot and the Custom Bots have had a really big impact on us being able to manage our conversation volume. We’re also heavily using Articles so customers are empowered to self-serve answers to their questions, which has freed up our care team to deal with more urgent issues,” Victoria says. “In less than six months, we’ve moved from having a median first-response time of 45 minutes to just 10 minutes – an 80% reduction.” Offering help before it’s needed
Both Vincent and Victoria point to the team’s focus on building out proactive support in the year ahead. With efforts across the company to improve smart alerting functionality in their product, Spendesk’s support team is looking to leverage these alerts to better understand where customers are running into roadblocks while using the platform and offer support before it’s needed. “We want to be able to identify what the recurring patterns are, whether they’re transaction failures or problems within the product, so we can take action and follow up with personalized messages to customers,” says Vincent. “We’re convinced that proactive support is something we should heavily invest in if we want to maintain the highest quality of support.” Driving better user experiences
With this sharp focus on proactively supporting their customers, Victoria explains that the customer success operations team has taken a number of steps in the past year to set their reps – and customers – up for future success. “About a year ago when we had customer issues, we weren’t immediately able to see what the issues were and what could be done. We decided to revamp our tech setup so we could better identify what the main issues are when customers write to us, and we’ve set up Custom Bots to categorize all of that information,” she says. Armed with these insights, the customer success operations team can provide valuable data to the product team so they can improve the user experience across the entire customer lifecycle. “Collecting and categorizing this information with the help of Custom Bots is a way for us to be more proactive in addressing the difficulties our customers are facing, and we can leverage that data internally to build a better user experience.” A better approach to customer communication
Within Spendesk, Vincent and Victoria point to the benefits they’ve experienced in being able to connect teams from across the company with their customers using Intercom. “We’ve found Intercom to be a great way of getting people from different teams involved and aware of what’s going on with our customers,” says Vincent. “We’re able to tag teammates in conversations to raise awareness of important issues, and also ensure we’re bringing the right people to the table to answer our customers’ questions.” By assigning tags to conversations, Vincent says that the team has also been able to more effectively collect and analyze customer feedback and trends in order to help them iterate and improve on their support. “It’s really important that we can gather specific feedback about things that are happening or going wrong and tag it so we can consistently improve our communication,” he says. Engaging customers at every stage of their journey
Outside of supporting their customers through Intercom, Victoria explains that the team is utilizing Series and Product Tours to send personalized messages to customers throughout their journey with the platform. “The fact that we’re able to integrate Intercom with other tools like Salesforce enables us to send tailored messages based on where customers are in their journey, if a specific event has been triggered, or if they’ve taken a particular action,” she says. From the moment a user first signs up to Spendesk, the team is sending targeted messages through Intercom to guide them through the onboarding process and ensure they’re set up for success. “We use Intercom for our onboarding flows, to share announcements about new features, and to re-engage customers. Having everything centralized is really helpful because it lets us create more personalized, automated messaging flows.” An all-in-one solution
Across support, sales, and marketing, the Spendesk team is building stronger and deeper relationships with their customers through Intercom’s conversational solutions. “I think we’re a good example of an Intercom success story,” says Vincent. “We started out using it to support our customers and progressively expanded our use to include marketing and, most recently, sales when we saw the potential the platform had to help us scale our business.” Check out the rest of our stories"

How Vend increased agent productivity by 48% with conversational support,"Cloud-based retail point-of-sale software Vend supports over 25,000 retailers around the world with the help of Intercom. As the first company in the industry to bring point-of-sale software to the cloud, Vend has cemented itself as the go-to solution for many of the world’s biggest retailers, including Disney, Sennheiser, and Etsy.
The platform integrates with major e-commerce and online payments platforms to help customers easily set up a multi-channel retail operation. With all of these moving parts and the fast-paced nature of the retail industry, Vend’s customers need a support solution that’s both timely and efficient, which is why Vend has been using Intercom to power its customer messaging since 2015. Using in-app messaging to drive conversions
Early on, Vend used Intercom to drive greater conversion of trial users and to upsell existing customers. Its marketing and sales teams needed a seamless way to communicate with users when they were coming to the end of their trial, or when there was an opportunity for them to maximize their use of the platform by upgrading. With email, Vend was seeing consistently low response and conversion rates across the board, so they went in search of a better solution – and discovered in-app messaging with Intercom.
By integrating Intercom with Salesforce, the marketing and sales teams were able to easily map out user behavior, segment their audience, and personalize in-app communication to users at optimal points throughout their journey. This migration from email to targeted, in-app messaging resulted in countless hours saved across both the marketing and sales teams, along with a staggering 30% increase in trial-to-paid conversions. Going all in with conversational support
Since then, Vend has significantly built out its use of Intercom, now using it to also power its customer support. Jack Harrison-Sherlock, Product Manager, says, “We knew that Intercom was already in the product and being used by our Sales team. Also, every time I’ve needed support with another system and they used Intercom, I’ve had nothing but great experiences. That's when it clicked that there is so much more we could do with Intercom across the business.” When COVID-19 hit and lockdown protocols came into effect, Vend’s support team, like many others, became remote overnight. They were also flooded with conversations from panicked customers whose businesses were being impacted, resulting in their conversation volume increasing by 24%. Because of this sudden pivot to working from home and the stress of supporting customers facing very difficult situations, Vend decided to turn off their phone and email support, and move entirely to chat. By making chat their primary support channel, Vend was able to give team members the space and flexibility they need at this time to support their global customer base. Jack says, “We’ve discovered a new working model for our team and it’s resulting in the highest engagement scores ever from the team.” The power of messenger-based support
The Intercom Business Messenger and Resolution Bot enable Vend’s support agents to keep their first response times to a minimum and resolve customer issues quickly – both of which are top priorities for the team. In fact, Jack shares, “With email, our response time used to be in the multi-hour range, but with Intercom we’ve been able to drop that to 10 minutes. Contacts per agent increased by 48% while our CSAT score stayed above 90%.” Speaking further to the power of live chat and messenger-based support, Jack, says, “Email can be a really unproductive channel for support, with a lot of time lost amongst teammates sharing tickets, trying to gather information, and context shifting between each reply. With chat, there’s ownership from beginning to end, which is not only a better experience for us, but also for our customers.”
With Intercom, Vend’s support team can collect valuable information about the problem a customer is facing upfront, making it easier, faster, and more efficient to provide a solution. In addition to improving the experience of their customers, this has also resulted in increased productivity across the team. As Jack puts it, “As soon as we switched over to Intercom, we saw a huge jump in productivity. Not only were we able to avoid the back-and-forth of trying to gather context from customers, but we were also able to remove the manual need of finding the next ticket for our support agents to work on.” Transforming onboarding with proactive support
As part of the transition to chat support, Jack's team partnered with the operations team to re-examine every stage of the customer journey. They interviewed a number of customers across all product areas, and held focus groups with the support team to identify the points where customers needed the most support. These conversations helped the team to understand common workflows their customers encounter, along with the problems they run into. Using this research, they were able to map out a winning proactive support strategy and set up a dedicated onboarding team to help them get their support right from the get-go. Using Intercom's Product Tours, the dedicated onboarding team have been able to create customized walkthroughs of the platform, combining videos, engaging messages, and tooltips to maximize the success of their customers as they’re onboarded to the product. A big focus for the team with designing these guided tours is to showcase the wide variety of e-commerce integrations Vend offers – something that’s become incredibly important as consumer shopping habits continue to move online. The team also introduced messages that triggered based on how their customers are interacting with the product and what steps they have or haven’t taken. For example, during setup, the Vend team detects whether customers have reviewed their tax settings so that the right pricing is automatically applied once products are uploaded. If customers bypass this stage, they receive an in-app message reminding them to configure those settings before they move forward with setup. Jack says, “Intercom’s a very intuitive system. You get a lot of insight into how people are using the product – it’s really powerful.” Creating a smarter support experience
For Vend, Jack says, “The ultimate goal is to be able to wrap a human-centric layer of automation over our customer journey, and to only intervene when the retailer really needs us.” Intercom’s combination of self-serve and human support makes this goal possible, with Vend’s operations team working to curate answers for Resolution Bot regularly. Using Intercom’s reports, the team can closely monitor the performance of Resolution Bot’s answers and iterate to continuously improve the customer experience. By leveraging Resolution Bot to answer frequently asked questions, Vend’s support team can be freed up to deal with more complex queries, with the bot currently resolving one in every five inbound conversations. Since implementing Intercom, Vend has seen a whopping 30% increase in its agents’ CSAT score – something that has been a key health metric for the overall business since COVID-19. Having used a combination of chat, email, and phone support, Jack notes that chat is by far the team’s highest channel for customer satisfaction, going on to say, “Over half of our conversations in Intercom receive comments with feedback – our retailers love to chat with us.”"
SMARTY reduced their median first-response time by 99% with Intercom,"In an industry filled with complex and confusing tariffs, SMARTY is on a mission to bring simplicity to mobile phone plans. Powered by Three UK, the mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) uses Intercom to deliver great customer experiences along the way. Gill Fisher, Head of Customer Experience & Delivery at SMARTY, is responsible for turning the company’s vision into reality. Gill and her team of customer champions strive to provide the best possible quality of service and experiences for their customers, while striking a balance between being efficient and personal. Powering support at scale
Having enjoyed exponential growth over the past 12 months, Gill says Intercom was pivotal in enabling SMARTY to scale to meet the needs of its growing customer base. As expected with such rapid growth, the team saw inbound conversation volumes rise dramatically during 2020. Starting the year at 30,000 monthly customer conversations, that number quickly rose by 69%, with the team now managing up to 56,000 chats a month during its busiest periods. Gill explains that by using Intercom’s Team Inbox management features and powerful automation capabilities, the team was in a strong position to manage this sharp increase and continue to create the same, conversational experiences their customers expected. Creating personal experiences
“Intercom is pivotal for us, it’s the one and only way that we’re able to talk to our customers in real time. It really helps us engage with them,” says Gill. Having used other support platforms in the past, she explains that they don’t offer the same level of customer insight as Intercom, which makes it almost impossible to create tailored, personal support experiences. With Intercom, Gill highlights that the team is able to communicate in a conversational way through the messenger, keeping customer interactions friendly and helping them to build lasting relationships. “Intercom’s the most inspiring tool I’ve ever used to connect with our customers, it lets us use gifs and emojis so we can build that rapport with our customers, which is so important,” she says. Balancing the workload
When Gill stepped into her role as Head of Customer Experience & Delivery, there were a number of immediate problems to be solved. The massive spike in growth meant SMARTY’s support advisors were faced with a backlog of over 2,000 conversations, with some customers waiting over four days for a response, and a support team that was feeling overwhelmed. Gill leveraged Intercom’s workload management feature, which enabled her to look at the situation holistically and make critical resourcing decisions. In splitting up the workload and limiting the number of conversations a support advisor could handle at any one time, Gill says they were able to navigate through the backlog and maintain a high level of employee satisfaction. “Utilizing all the features that Intercom offers like workload management, we were able to balance the work we were giving to advisors so they weren’t getting overwhelmed. It’s been an absolute lifesaver,” she says. Creating alignment
Gill highlights three key capabilities as standout benefits of Intercom:
Ease of use: Being able to seamlessly onboard support advisors in multiple sites and getting them aligned on how they work.
Bots: Gill’s team has saved 7,000 support team hours in the last year by empowering their customers to help themselves with Custom Bots and Resolution Bot.
Articles: Having their help desk and knowledge base hosted on a single platform enables the team to create a seamless journey for their customers. “What I love about Intercom is that it completely aligns with our brand value of being simple. I’ve worked with different platforms in the past and they’re clunky, legacy systems, whereas Intercom’s easy to use and seamlessly integrates with our website. Our advisors shouldn’t even have to think about the platform they’re using, they should just have to focus on creating great experiences for our customers,” Gill explains. Seeing immediate results
After working through their chat backlog, Gill notes the team began to see some incredible results. In January of last year, their median first-response time stood at just over a day, but using Intercom, they have been able to reduce that to three minutes – a staggering 99% drop. Intercom’s self-serve support capabilities have also been hugely impactful in helping SMARTY support their customers. As Gill explains, “Intercom’s Resolution Bot is now resolving 12% of our total chat volume. That amounts to 37,000 conversations a year, or 7,000 support team hours saved – which is amazing!” Leveraging Articles to power their help center, Gill’s team also supports the company’s marketing campaigns. “We launched a big campaign around our new “WiFi calling” feature recently that directed people straight to the help center. They were able to get all the information they needed before speaking with our team, and it actually reduced the number of chats coming in,” Gill says, “I think chat should just be there for those more complex queries. If there’s something a customer can do really easily, why not utilize the bot, why not utilize the help center?” Staying ahead of the curve
Using reporting in Intercom, the support team analyzes customer conversations to understand how their needs are evolving, spot recurring trends, and get ahead of known issues to proactively support their customers. As Gill explains, staying ahead of the curve has been a game-changer in efficiently scaling their support. “Intercom lets us look at any themes or trending topics that we might not have spotted yet. A recent example of this is that we saw a rise in inbound questions from customers asking, ‘Where’s my sim?’ and two days later it was announced that there were national mail delays due to resourcing issues, so we were able to get ahead of that and support customers while it was being resolved.” Highlighting the benefits of being able to easily analyze and report out on support performance and customer insights from a single platform, Gill says, “The way the data is presented to you in Intercom’s Conversation Topics feature is fantastic. I can quickly log in and see that the biggest topic is ‘undelivered sim’ and we’ll know to go and focus on that. It’s great,” she explains, “When I’ve used other systems, you’d have to take all your data, put it in a spreadsheet, and do some analysis. Intercom’s Conversation Topics tells me at the click of a button. It allows us to be proactive in where we help our customers most, which is amazing.” Championing customer happiness
The highest priority for the SMARTY team is ensuring that their customers consistently have great experiences with their service – and it shows. Over the last year, Gill and the team have increased their NPS score by an impressive 17 points. Acknowledging that temporary outages and issues can cause customer satisfaction to fluctuate, Gill points to Intercom as a key driver in monitoring customer sentiment, enabling her team to quickly spot when temporary issues arise and put action plans in place to maintain the high quality of service they pride themselves on. “Intercom’s great at helping us pinpoint where customer issues are – we use everything from conversation tags to conversation topics to get a clear picture of where we need to jump in. It’s so seamless,” she explains. Planning for the future
With big plans for the future, the team at SMARTY has no intention of slowing down. Confident that Intercom will be a key partner in their continued growth, Gill points to the three big objectives her team is focused on in the year ahead: unlocking more of Intercom’s capabilities to further supercharge their support, expanding their reporting to measure bottom-line metrics like customer retention, and most importantly, “to get to true live chat,” she says, “I don’t want any first-response time to be over a minute.” Speaking about why SMARTY chose Intercom as their partner in supporting and engaging their customers, Gill says, “We chose not to have a phone line because we’re a truly digital business. Intercom helps us to support that because it’s a truly digital platform.” Check out the rest of our stories"
TrueCommerce reduced inbound conversation volume by 20% with proactive and self-serve support,"As experts in integrated commerce solutions, the TrueCommerce team uses Intercom to support its customer base of suppliers, retailers, brands, manufacturers, and logistics service providers. With its unified commerce platform, TrueCommerce combines sophisticated supply chain automation with a personal touch.
For the past 25 years, TrueCommerce has been helping over 13,000 customers across three continents be more connected, more supported, and more prepared for growth. By creating a central hub to integrate everything from EDI to inventory management, fulfillment, digital storefronts and marketplaces, business systems, and more, they help their customers do business in every direction. Their Foundry Platform empowers businesses to connect virtually any organization or service to their supply chain ecosystem, and deliver an exceptional customer experience. Great customer experience is also at the heart of what TrueCommerce does, and the team has been using Intercom to provide their customers with a personal, all-in-one support solution since 2018. 
The launch of in-app support
In recent years, TrueCommerce has significantly expanded its product offering, with customers now able to visually package and manage warehouse orders and shipments for their solutions. They can also leverage one of the platform’s many ecommerce integrations to sell their products on household-name websites like Amazon, Walmart, or Target – with TrueCommerce managing everything behind the scenes.
The Foundry Platform acts as the central hub for customers, where they can manage everything from inventory planning to designing their own digital storefront. There, they can also access the TrueCommerce Support Center directly if issues arise. With up to 13,000 customers signed in at any given moment, the team knew that a reliable support system that is accessible from all areas of the platform was critical. They chose to power their Support Center using Intercom. Unlike email or other non-chat support channels, this kind of in-app support gives customer the ability to seek support at the exact time – and in the exact place – their issue is happening.
Having looked at and tested alternative chat solutions prior to moving to Intercom, Christian Parker, Vice President of Managed Services, says, “We knew our users were going to need chat, so it was just a really easy decision to pull Intercom in. We did try other solutions like Enghouse chat, but Intercom was lightyears ahead of everybody and is really easy to install.” Having experienced Intercom as an end user prior to implementing it at TrueCommerce, Christian goes on to say, “I remember thinking, ‘This is amazing! I love this’.” Christian’s team of service and support specialists use the Intercom Messenger to provide real time, personal support to their customers when they need it most. They receive over 10,000 customer contacts a month, so it’s essential that the team has a way to quickly understand who they’re chatting with. Using a custom integration between Intercom and NetSuite, their CRM, the team is able to easily send data attributes from one system to another, such as the products and integrations the customer is using and who their account manager is. These attributes give the team valuable context as they’re chatting with customers so they are able to better personalize their support and ensure a positive customer experience. Offering just-in-time proactive support
Given the high number of active users signed in at any given time, it’s important for the team to be able to quickly communicate with users when the need arises. The Intercom platform helps the team identify which customers are online when they need to send an alert out and use Intercom’s outbound messages to proactively communicate with affected customers. Through these efforts, the support team has seen a dramatic decrease of almost 80% for the contact rate by affected users when temporary issues come up, as they already know how to take action.
“By targeting specific users who are active in the product when issues come up, we’re able to let them know we’re already on it and how they can stay updated,” Christian explains. Providing this type of targeted support at the precise moment it’s needed, without having to send a mass communication to all customers – many of whom may not be impacted by it – is one of the many reasons TrueCommerce chose Intercom. Self-serve support for common questions
In addition to proactive support, TrueCommerce uses self-serve support features within Intercom, such as Articles and Custom Bots, to answer commonly asked questions and serve up relevant help center content to customers. The team also embeds their own status page directly within Intercom so they can direct customers to it when there’s a known outage, and they’ve also built a series of custom apps with the Intercom API to enable customers to submit and manage email tickets from directly within the Messenger. Overall, the combination of self-service and proactive support has helped TrueCommerce reduce its inbound conversation volume by 20% over the past two years, even as its user base has continued to grow. Looking ahead, Christian and his team plan to further build out their self-serve support offering, tailoring all of their existing help center articles to fit their expanding portfolio of products. Building a modern support experience The move to Intercom has been met with resounding praise from TrueCommerce’s customers. Christian’s ultimate vision is to move away from large email threads as a form of support, explaining that it’s inefficient and doesn’t provide a good experience to the customer. TrueCommerce acts as a central hub for its customers, with quick and detailed answers in the product, which is exactly why the support team chose Intercom as its support platform. In Christian’s own words, “Our customers were getting tired of having to go to different places to get the answer they needed. They were so excited about Intercom – they just fell in love with it.”"
Livestorm books 233% more sales demos with Intercom,"Livestorm is a video conferencing platform that enables businesses to communicate better, offering them the ability to host webinars, meetings, and online events.
Using Intercom to power their sales and support, Livestorm’s 100-strong team engages visitors from the moment they land on the website and throughout their lifecycle journey using the product. Thibaut Davoult, Head of Growth, and Elif Koral, Head of Customer Experience, at Livestorm, explain that having a single platform for sales and support boasts a number of advantages. Not only does it enable teams from across the company to collaborate cross-functionally with ease, it’s also a key component in them being able to create a strong, consistent experience for their customers. A unified customer experience
“Intercom is crucial across our sales and customer support operations at Livestorm,” says Thibaut. Overseeing the growth team, he’s responsible for making the sales process as smooth and efficient as possible and enabling sales reps to have conversations with prospects through the Intercom Messenger. In addition to this, Thibaut explains that his team is focused on engaging customers at various points throughout the customer journey and making sure they’re maximizing their use of the platform. The team uses a combination of chat and email to engage their customers, with all email replies routed back into Intercom to seamlessly manage communication in one place. When it comes to supporting Livestorm’s customers, Elif and her team of customer support champions are on a mission to balance efficiency with a personal approach to ensure their customers get the best possible experience when they write to the team. “When I joined the team, we were using Drift. I lobbied to make the switch to Intercom because of its superior UX and automation capabilities,” says Elif. With Intercom, the team can combine powerful inbox management and self-serve support capabilities to triage customer queries, collect valuable context upfront to reach quicker resolutions, and empower customers to help themselves. Clear communication
With a vision to “create simpler ways for people to connect, no matter where they are,” as Thibaut puts it, the Livestorm team wanted to find a solution to power their sales and support that would embody this vision of clear and simple communication – which is what brought them to Intercom. Using Intercom’s Conversational Support, Engagement, and Marketing solutions, Thibaut notes that teams from across the company are able to communicate seamlessly with their customers, which is of the utmost importance. “We wanted to make it as easy as possible to have conversations with our customers and solve their problems,” Elif adds. Taking a combined approach to customer support
In the support organization, Elif explains that the team combines elements of proactive, self-serve, and invaluable human support to cater to the needs of their customers. This approach sets the team up to effectively manage the large volume of support queries that they receive. Across sales and support, the Livestorm team’s total inbound conversation volume has risen from 1,000 monthly conversations to just over 13,400 in less than 12 months. Despite this spike in conversation volume, the team has been able to remain efficient, maintaining a median response time of just over six minutes for their VIP support tier. Thanks to Intercom’s bots and automation capabilities, Elif notes that Livestorm’s support agents can be freed up to focus on more sensitive and urgent customer queries. Personalized support
Elif notes that Intercom’s flexibility and customization allows them to completely personalize the experience of their customers based on who’s writing to the team, which has been a game changer for their support. When a customer lands on the website, the Intercom Messenger appears with tailored messages to meet their needs based on what the team knows about their account. “We have three main tiers of support,” Elif says. “Within these tiers, our support team is broken down to specialize in different areas of the product, so it’s crucial that incoming queries are routed to the right team. Intercom lets us customize that journey and run automation in the background with the help of Custom Bots so customers are being helped at the right time and by the right person.” Maintaining efficiency – while staying personal
When Elif joined Livestorm three and a half years ago, she did so as the first support agent on the team. Since then, she has worked to build the support organization from the ground up, leveraging Intercom to find opportunities to make their support as efficient as possible – without sacrificing the personal touch. “Intercom’s been a key tool for us since the beginning,” she says. When it comes to supporting their customers, Elif explains that the team upholds a number of best practices, such as maintaining a robust knowledge base with articles customers can reference, and updating macros that teammates can personalize to help them manage large volumes of inbound queries. “Our philosophy on the team is that going the extra mile for our customers is key. We also value transparency and ownership – both as a support team and as a company. We’re honest with our customers about when there’s an issue.” This approach to customer support is clearly paying off, with the team maintaining an impressive customer satisfaction score of 94%. Supercharged sales and engagement
Outside of support, the Livestorm team uses Intercom to convert and engage users in a number of ways, including:
Using automation and bots to guide users through the process of booking a demo.
Providing education on new features and changes through Product Tours.
Leveraging inbox management capabilities such as assignment rules to ensure prospect conversations are routed to the right team. As Thibaut explains, “We’re using Product Tours a lot on the engagement side. It’s really nice to have a way to bring customers out of emails and into the product. With email, you can give customers the documentation they need with some insights into how the feature works, but nothing beats actually having them try it out for themselves within the product.” Speaking further to the clear advantage of communicating with customers directly within the product, rather than through email, Thibaut says, “Product Tours give customers the direct reward of completing the step, and not just reading about it.” And the results speak for themselves. Since the team implemented Product Tours, they’re seeing an average completion rate across all of their tours of 50% – with some reaching as high as 95%. Championing close collaboration
As Livestorm continues on its rapid growth trajectory, maintaining close alignment is a top priority for the team. And having experienced a headcount jump of 400% in less than 12 months, knowing that the tools they use can facilitate seamless collaboration is critical. “It’s super helpful that people from across the company can access the customer conversation history and account information that Intercom provides,” Thibaut says. “Other teams are able to analyze both sales and support conversations and notes to get a better understanding of our customers and the journeys they’ve taken up to that point, which saves us a lot of time.” The team has also integrated Intercom with their wider product tech stack so they can use customer feedback to inform their product roadmap and communicate fixes and updates back to customers through conversations in Intercom. Planning for the future
Looking ahead, Livestorm has plans to further expand their use of Intercom. Elif explains that the team is focused on expanding proactive support and digging deeper into customer data in Intercom to create more robust reports. “Last year was all about testing, experimenting, and improving our internal processes. We want to look at data from conversations and our bots and create powerful reporting to better understand our prospects and customers,” she says. Adding to this, Thibaut notes, “Intercom really helps us make sense of the traffic that’s hitting our website, as well as to have conversations with these visitors and turn them into leads. The number of monthly inbound demos booked has increased by 233% since we started using Intercom to power our sales. We have big growth ambitions for the year ahead, both for our team and our use of Intercom.” Check out the rest of our stories"
Outschool used Intercom to reduce FRT by 91% throughout rapid business growth,"Challenge
Online education platform Outschool experienced a whopping 10x growth with the onset of the pandemic – with only two people working on support. This resulted in a huge backlog of customer conversations that the team needed to manage.
They wanted to make sure customers were being responded to in a timely fashion, as well as ensuring their team could be as efficient as possible while providing support at scale to support the business’s growth. With surging conversation volume, they needed to enhance their self-serve support offering to meet customers’ expectations of fast responses, as well as free up the team’s time. Solution
Outside of its own admin tool, Outschool uses Intercom as its primary platform for customer engagement. The team also uses the platform to power customer support and create stellar experiences for its customers. For Outschool, some big benefits of Intercom are that it’s flexible, has a good UI, enables low-code customer engagement, and has a lot of features that meet the team’s needs, meaning they don’t have to use a ton of different tools. Any additional tools they do need are well integrated with Intercom, including Slack, Google Forms, Automate.io, Airtable, Lokalise, Jira, and Klaus, to ensure their systems are in sync and they can get a single view of customer accounts and conversation history.
The team likes that Intercom unifies their customer communications to give them a more holistic view of the customer experience. They use Outbound Messages, Product Tours, and Banners to engage customers and set them up for success using Outschool. They’ve created sophisticated ticket assignment and routing rules to ensure they can manage surges in inbound conversation volume efficiently and provide engaging, consistent customer experiences as their business continues to grow.

Ringostat converts 76% of leads generated through Intercom and keeps FRT to one minute,"Part of the Netpeak Group, Ukrainian call tracking, telephony, and end-to-end analytics platform Ringostat uses Intercom to power communications across the entire customer journey, from acquisition to ongoing engagement and support. This enables the team to drive business growth and create strong customer experiences at every touchpoint.
For Ringostat, being able to respond to customer queries in real-time is of the utmost importance to the team. Their previous communications stack was made up of disparate systems and channels, which proved to be inefficient, as well as inconvenient for their customers. To tackle this challenge, the team went in search of a platform that would enable them to unify their communication channels and create stellar customer experiences – which is what brought them to Intercom. Having started out using Intercom for support, they've since expanded its use to marketing and sales messaging. With a single platform underpinning their communications, they’re empowered to create consistent, engaging experiences and scale their business. Out with the old, in with the new
Ringostat’s previous customer support solution wasn’t enabling them to meet their customers’ needs, as Eugene Zastup, Head of Customer Care at Ringostat, explains. “We initially used a combination of phone, Skype, and social media messengers to provide customer support, but we often need to exchange screenshots and links to help resolve our customers’ queries,” he says. “Because of that, we found that it was inefficient for both our team and our customers, and led to several problems that we needed to solve.”
The core problems that Ringostat identified were:
Inability to scale: With the support team constantly monitoring all communication channels, scaling was a huge challenge.
Poor customer experience: Not having a unified view of customers’ questions meant that some were left unanswered or customers were left waiting for long periods of time. It also became increasingly difficult to effectively manage responses to customers to notify them when their issue had been resolved.
Inefficient workflows: Without a single view of the customer, the team needed to collect information from various tools to help resolve their issue. It also meant that if reps needed to pull in other teammates from across the company to collaborate, they had to brief them on the customer’s query each time, all of which was time-consuming. Tackling the problems to be solved – and driving results
Since implementing Intercom, Ringostat has been able to make their communications more efficient, save time, and unify their support channels to get a holistic view of their customer messaging. With enhanced cross-functional collaboration and reporting to monitor customer satisfaction and team performance, Ringostat has also been empowered to produce great customer outcomes – from faster response times to a better overall customer experience. The team has been able to:
Decrease their first-response time (FRT) to just one minute.
Effectively provide product education and self-serve resources to customers through the Intercom Messenger.
Leverage Intercom’s auto-assignment feature to remove manual tasks from the team’s workflows and streamline their support.
Collaborate seamlessly with teammates from across the company to resolve customer queries.
Gather valuable context about customers when they’re writing to the team so they know who they are and what their communication history with Ringostat has been up to that point. This not only results in efficiency gains for the team, but a far better experience for the customer.
Leverage Intercom’s reporting to track team performance and KPIs, as well as flag potential detractors so a Support team lead can reach out to the customer and learn more about their experience. Growing with Intercom
Ringostat began their journey with Intercom as a startup and have grown with the platform over the past 8 years, continually adopting more features and functionality to support their business growth. During that time, they expanded their use of the platform to also power their marketing and sales efforts. “Initially, we only used Intercom for our technical support, then we added the Sales team, and then Marketing. We’re always happy to try Intercom’s new features as we know they’re going to make our lives a lot easier.” says Alex Kiselyov, Marketing Director at Ringostat.
The team now leverages Intercom to send tailored communications to customers at every stage of their journey, understanding their needs based on their on-site behavior and activity so they can contact them in the right place, at the right time, and with the right message. “We try to predict our customers’ behavior on every page of our website. We want them to know that we’re paying attention to their needs so we can tailor their experience,” says Alex. Targeted messages
The team personalizes their messaging to meet visitors where they are on Ringostat’s website, so they can tailor their experience and offer in-context help where it’s needed. This has enabled them to leverage the Intercom Messenger as the source of their highest quality leads, converting from trials to paid subscriptions at an impressive rate of 76%. Ringostat also uses targeted messaging to share promotions with specific segments of customers, which enables them to customize their messaging to be in the customer’s chosen language and currency.
Onboarding cadences
With such a varied product offering, adopting a one-size-fits-all approach to onboarding isn’t an option for the Ringostat team. They use Intercom to send a sequence of messages to customers when they sign up that inquire about what problems they want to solve and what they want to get out of the platform. This helps Ringostat to tailor each customer’s experience accordingly and share relevant resources to ensure they’re maximizing their use of the platform to reach their goals.
Announcements
Every month, the team shares product announcements with customers to let them know what improvements have been made to the platform and how they can be set up for success using new features. Ringostat can leverage omnichannel messaging in Intercom to set up in-app messages, with the option of sending a follow-up email if the customer hasn’t seen the message in the first few days of it being live.
Banners
Intercom’s Banners feature enables Ringostat to inform customers about certain promotions or updates in an unobtrusive way. Previously, the team’s website banners had to be set up manually, which was time-consuming. With Intercom, they’re able to set them up quickly and easily, which is a big benefit to the team. Speaking to the benefits of being able to communicate with customers in so many different ways, Alyona Voloshyna, Marketing Specialist at Ringostat, says, “It’s great that we’re able to customize our messaging to suit the playful voice and tone of our brand and reach people where they are. We regularly share fun messages and GIFs and see high conversion rates in response to those messages,” she says. “For example, if a visitor has been on our site for a while, we trigger a pop-up message with a GIF of a cat to capture their attention, and we see a lot of people engaging with that.” Alex adds, “It’s also hugely helpful that we can route leads who engage with our messages directly to the Sales team and reduce the amount of inbound conversations being added to our support queue.” An integrated tech stack
Ringostat connects a variety of tools to Intercom via API to streamline their workflows across the company:
Ringostat: The team has their own platform connected with Intercom to enrich Intercom’s customer data with call data. This allows them to have all customer communication history in one place.
Octopods: By plugging their social media support channels into Intercom using Octopods, the team can manage omnichannel support through a single Inbox, helping them to keep track of their inbound volume with ease.
Pipedrive: Ringostat’s Sales team uses Pipedrive as their CRM. With the Intercom and Pipedrive integration, sales reps can seamlessly create deals in Pipedrive to track leads that they've captured through Intercom. Building for the future
Ringostat is excited to continue to scale with Intercom and leverage its customer support, engagement, and sales capabilities to drive bottom-line results – and create great customer experiences – long into the future. “Intercom’s a very powerful solution for us as it’s constantly evolving, which enables us to pivot to meet our customers’ needs as we grow,” says Eugene. “The attention to detail in the platform is one of our favorite things about it – it’s easy and enjoyable to use.” Adding to this, Alex notes, “We’re extremely happy that we were able to find a platform that not only solves all of our problems, but also opens up new opportunities for us that we couldn’t even have imagined.”"
3Commas used Intercom to unify customer communications and create stellar experiences at scale,"Challenge
Crypto trading platform 3Commas needed to consolidate their communications into a single platform that enabled multilingual support and engagement for their growing customer base. The marketing team wanted more flexibility than their previous set-up offered to be able to send highly targeted messages to customers at the right time and in the right place.
Their previous support solution, Zendesk, didn’t provide the all-in-one solution the team needed. With up to 92% of customers being directed straight to a support agent when they had a query, the team needed a solution that would enable them to scale efficiently – without losing the personal touch.  Solution 
With Intercom, 3Commas has unified its customer communications and can offer multilingual support and engagement to create strong, consistent experiences across the entire customer journey. Intercom is enabling teams from across the business to work fast and efficiently and build lasting relationships with their customers through personalized communications.
Marketing: the team uses Intercom’s visual campaign builder, Series, to A/B test campaigns and use the insights to create engaging customer experiences. The flexibility of the platform allows them to set up and run campaigns seamlessly and run quick analysis on performance without having to wait for the analytics team, saving valuable time. 
Support: the team leverages Intercom features like Macros to save time and make replying to the 15,000 conversations they receive every month more efficient. Using Custom Bots and Resolution Bot, they can resolve commonly-asked questions and triage queries automatically. Intercom’s automation features make it easy to analyze conversations and drive continuous improvement across the team. These powerful tools have enabled 3Commas to adapt to a growing customer base without having to hire additional support reps to keep up with the volume.  Check out the rest of our stories"
Grover reduced first-response time by 79% with bots and automation,"Technology subscription platform Grover is on a mission to revolutionize how consumers access tech. From smartphones to gaming consoles, the team is committed to offering more freedom, flexibility, and choice to buyers through renting.
Using Intercom to power their customer support and on-site marketing, Grover is focused on creating strong experiences across the entire customer lifecycle. Having previously used Zendesk, Jason Efstathiou, Product Manager & UX Designer at Grover, explains that what set Intercom apart was its ability to offer personalized support and engagement through conversations. In support of their mission to “create the most innovative ways for everyone to get the tech that they want,” as Jason puts it, the team’s North Star is maintaining a high standard of operational excellence behind the scenes. When assessing customer communication platforms, they knew they needed a solution that would empower them to maintain that high bar of excellence – which is what brought them to Intercom. “We find Intercom to be extremely useful as a customer support tool that really goes the extra mile, both from the customer’s perspective and ours. It makes getting in touch with us a great experience, and offers lots of features that make us more efficient,” says Jason. Improving the customer experience
Grover moved from Zendesk to Intercom because they wanted to improve their customer experience. “Intercom stood out to us because the messages are polished and the UX is good,” Jason says. “The API and Canvas Kit sealed the deal for us. When we assessed different tools, the extensibility of Intercom was pretty much unmatched.” Above all else, they wanted to move their support to a platform that embodied the same spirit of innovation that they champion throughout the business. As Jason explains, “We really liked that Intercom enabled our support to be conversational, rather than being based on tickets or emails.” Ciro Ferraiuolo, Grover’s Head of Customer Support, agrees. “Intercom has definitely changed the way we support our customers. In our industry, customers want quick answers and resolutions, both of which we’re now able to provide.” Getting ahead of problems with proactive support
Grover uses Banners to proactively communicate with their customers, getting ahead of known issues in an effort to reduce inbound conversation volume to the support team. By adding targeted banners to their website, they’re able to let customers know about important updates related to their account, such as whether there’s an outstanding balance that needs to be paid. When customers interact with the banner, they’re directed to the help center where they can self-serve the information they need to take action. By leveraging proactive support in this way, the team has been able to successfully prompt action from customers while also driving down their inbound support volume, seeing an impressive 36% completion rate on their “Outstanding amount” banner. Driving results through automation
Grover’s product team has built a robust suite of custom apps and automated workflows to underpin their support operation. With sophisticated bots on the frontline to answer common questions, collect valuable information upfront, and triage conversations, the support team can be freed up to deal with more complex and sensitive queries. “There are times when customers have complex questions that bots aren’t able to answer, which is where humans come in. I think that support teams should only intervene when a human touch is really needed,” Ciro explains. Using a combination of Resolution Bot and Custom Bots, Jason and team have invested heavily in making their self-serve support journey a seamless experience for their customers – and the results speak for themselves. “Our main custom bot, which interacts with all customers when they write to us, resolved almost 20,000 conversations in January. That’s pretty huge,” Jason explains. “Resolution Bot also answers 30% of our common questions automatically. We frequently check the questions that it can’t answer and use that to prioritize new custom integrations that allow customers to self-serve.” This focus on solving customer problems enables the team to keep customer satisfaction high, maintaining a CSAT score of 83%. Increasing efficiency with inbox tools and custom apps
Leveraging Intercom’s inbox management capabilities, Jason explains that they’ve been able to set up assignment rules for routing issues to the right team and indicating whether an issue is urgent. They’ve also created custom views to enhance organization and prioritization across their team inboxes. “The flexibility of assignment rules has been a godsend. We’ve also found views extremely useful as they allow us to filter out specific types of issues and assign dedicated agents to work on them,” he says. The team has also built a range of custom apps for Intercom, enabling them to integrate tools in their wider tech stack to boost support efficiency and enhance their customer journeys.
“Order cancellation” app
Grover’s “Order cancellation” app empowers customers to self-serve through the cancellation process with the help of Resolution Bot. With this one app, the team has seen a total reduction in inbound conversations of 10%, resolving more than 1,000 conversations per week.
“Last viewed subscription” app
This app enables Grover’s support agents to leverage relevant product data, such as the customer’s last viewed subscription, to solve customer queries faster and ensure customers have a great experience when they contact the team.
“Verify” app
Grover’s “Verify” app allows the support team to perform two-factor authentication (2FA) directly in the Intercom Messenger. Jason notes that it’s brought the team’s time to resolve sensitive GDPR requests down by close to 50%.
“Operations request” app
To ensure alignment between the operations and support teams, Jason explains that they’ve built an app that enables support agents to create tasks in Asana from right within a conversation in Intercom. This facilitates easier tracking of customer requests and increased efficiency across both teams.
“Numbers finder” app
Grover’s “Numbers finder” app helps support agents keep track of the many order and subscription numbers being mentioned in customer conversations by pulling them directly into the conversation view. Speedy support that stays personal
At the beginning of last year, Jason notes that the team’s average first-response time was sitting at 17 hours – a number they were determined to curtail. By focusing on building out their self-serve support capabilities and automation, they were able to reduce that number by 79%, and it now sits at just over 3 hours. “We saw an immediate decrease in our response time after introducing Custom Bots last year and decided to invest more in building out efficiency-increasing functionality and making better use of Intercom’s features,” Jason says. Thanks to these enhancements, Grover’s support team is now equipped to manage the 37,000 monthly conversations they receive with ease.
Creating a tailored experience across the full customer lifecycle
Serving both B2B and B2C customers, Jason explains that the ability to customize viewer permissions in Intercom Articles has been a game changer for their team. “We’re running a few invite-only betas, and being able to only show articles about the betas to the customers who are enrolled has been super useful. We also often write two versions of our articles – one for a B2B audience and one for B2C – so it’s great that we’re able to show the relevant articles to the right customers.” Outside of support, the team leverages Intercom’s Conversational Marketing solution to engage and convert website visitors, using Custom Bots to qualify leads on the B2B side of the business. Grover’s product organization also leans heavily on Intercom to get a deep understanding of their customers. “We use Intercom a lot for UX research, where its conversational approach really shines from our point of view. We also use Series to trigger surveys and segment customers for tests, and facilitate direct conversations between customers and UX researchers internally,” Jason says.
Planning for the future
Looking ahead, Grover has plans to further build out their use of Intercom across sales, marketing, and support, focusing on continuously improving the experiences of their customers and adapting to meet their needs as they evolve. “We have a lot of ideas to create even better experiences for our customers in the future, and I’m definitely looking forward to working with Intercom to build them,” says Ciro.

How Smartly.io uses customer support to win enterprise customers,"With thousands of advertising dollars on the line, marketers need a high degree of confidence that their tools won’t let them down as they rapidly test and optimize ad campaigns. The stellar customer support that social ad automation platform Smartly.io provides gives marketers the reassurance they’re looking for. 
Creating this kind of support requires a special mindset on the team, bolstered by investment in the right tools. A lot of companies treat support as just another cost center, but at Smartly.io, the team embraces support as a competitive advantage in an industry that’s often high pressure and ever-changing. Intercom has helped them maintain that competitive edge with its open platform and collaboration features. As a result, Smartly.io’s support has helped the company win big-name customers like Uber, eBay, Walmart, McDonald’s, and Under Armour. Director of Service Operations Marc-Olivier Meunier says: “Since the start, support has been at the heart of the company. Our 10x growth in the last 5 years wouldn’t have been possible without Intercom.” 
Providing a reassuring support experience
The need to scale customer support led Smartly.io to Intercom over five years ago. With ad tech tools constantly evolving, the Smartly.io team needed to give its customers an easy way to troubleshoot issues at any time – or risk customer dissatisfaction and churn.  
Marc-Olivier explains, “Most of our customers are dealing with fairly urgent questions and they can’t afford to wait 24 hours for an answer. Chat lets us give them fast feedback and creates a great support experience.” 
To deliver fast response times, the Smartly.io team chose to use chat as the primary way to support customers from the very start. At first, Smartly.io tried supporting customers through Facebook Messenger; it also tested Skype for a while. But these tools lacked basic features like in-app messaging and didn’t give team members enough context about the customers they were chatting with. The team needed a more robust support tool that signaled to its customers that Smartly.io would be there for them in high-stakes moments. 
The team also needed a tool that offers strong collaboration features like a shared inbox and easy conversation routing. That’s because every team member answers support questions at Smartly.io, from execs to folks in marketing, finance, and even legal. This unique approach to support keeps the entire team close to customers and gives them the confidence that they’re building the right product features and services. According to Marc-Olivier, “You can’t do support if you don’t know the product inside out, or vice versa. By having everyone do support, we’re able to smash silos between teams.” Tailoring Intercom to their needs
Plenty of support tools on the market offer chat. But what convinced Smartly.io to go with Intercom over other conversational support tools was Intercom’s open API. The API gave them the ability to build custom dashboards and tailor Intercom to their needs. For instance, the team developed its own app that sits within the Intercom Inbox and gives team members a snapshot of the conversation history from the customer’s viewpoint. It tells team members at a glance who’s chatted with the customer recently, for how long, and in what order. This info gives team members much better context as they’re chatting with a customer. Another custom-built Inbox app shows the volume of conversations for each team member at any given moment. With this info, support team leads can easily assign incoming conversations to available team members and ensure that customers get a fast response. This setup has been so effective that the team’s been able to keep their time to first response consistently under 5 minutes. 
Intercom has also helped the team stay highly efficient. Using collaboration features like Intercom’s internal team notes, team members are able to easily loop in others for troubleshooting help when complex questions arise. By keeping the number of customer-facing handovers to a minimum and taking an empathetic tone with customers, the team keeps their CSAT scores consistently high. As Marc-Olivier sees it, “Our number one goal in support is to help our customers get back to work. When we solve their problem, we’re able to fix their frustration and put a smile back on their face.”

Great support that results in 10x growth
Intercom has supported Smartly.io in its rapid growth over the last 5 years, helping it to grow 10x. With Intercom at the core of its support tech stack, Smartly.io has been able to achieve a 97% CSAT score and respond to customers within five minutes of them writing in. Customers rank it as the #1 tool on the G2.com Relationship Index for Social Media Advertising, which measures customers’ satisfaction with various social media advertising tools and their support. Great customer support has become synonymous with the Smartly.io brand, allowing them to differentiate themselves from competitors, win big customers, and accelerate its growth."
How tado° shut off phone support and shortened its overall first-response time by 92% with Intercom,"Built for the modern world, tado° is an intelligent heating control app that’s changing the way we think about and consume energy. Having previously used Zendesk for customer support, the team saw a 92% decrease in first-response time and a 19% jump in SLA when they started using Intercom.
With 182 employees and more than $100 million in funding from investors such as E.ON, Amazon, and Siemens, tado°’s IoT product offering is revolutionizing the energy and utilities sector. Its smart thermostats and radiator valves are helping customers regulate their energy consumption, moving away from the ways of old and driving forward a new model of heating and cooling as a service. The team has been using Intercom since 2019 to support and engage customers at every stage of their journey. Working towards a sustainable future
The residential sector accounted for more than a quarter of all energy consumed in the EU in 2018 – and the heating of homes alone constituted 64% of that energy consumption. tado° is on a mission to significantly reduce this impact, with Martin Mason, Head of Customer and Employee Experience at tado° saying, “We’re here to help people take more responsibility for their energy consumption.” To ensure this new technology is widely accessible, tado° is leveraging Intercom’s proactive support capabilities to identify areas in its product where customers are at risk of running into difficulty and guide them through the process to ensure a smooth experience. Providing personal support – at any scale
Prior to using Intercom for customer support, Martin’s team was using a phone support system and Zendesk for email. When deciding to make the switch to Intercom, the team switched off phone support entirely, redirecting the 45,700 calls they were receiving every year to the Intercom Messenger. Martin explains, “We felt that phone support was a very inefficient way of working, and we could get swamped with volume without knowing when it was coming, or what the topic may be.” Since implementing Intercom just over a year ago, the support team has seen dramatic boosts in their results across the board. Despite having seen an increase in customer contact of over 100% since making the switch, their first-contact resolution rate has risen by an impressive 21%. The team has also seen a rise in overall CSAT, climbing from 79% to 87% overall, and maintaining a 90% chat satisfaction rate. Championing the voice of the customer 
tado° leverages self-serve support in the form of Articles to power its help center and Resolution Bot to interact with and solve problems for customers. To ensure that customers are getting a consistent experience, its CX Content and Comms team is responsible for ensuring the tado° voice and tone is carried through all of their help center documentation, in macros within the Intercom Inbox, and in the answers Resolution Bot is serving up to customers. Martin highlights Intercom’s focus on customer conversations and how that aligns with his own team’s values as a factor that drove their decision to move from Zendesk to Intercom, saying, “Something I really like about Intercom is that it sees the relationship with the customer as an ongoing conversation – not a stack of tickets.” Having information to answer questions in context
With Intercom’s Custom Bots, the team can collect valuable information upfront from customers, helping them to provide a faster and more informed resolution to their problem. Given the seasonal nature of the business in line with the weather conditions customers are experiencing, having a support system that can manage dramatic increases in scale is of the utmost importance. During its busiest periods, tado° typically experiences a rise in conversation volumes of anywhere up to 400%, seeing an average of 11,000 customer contacts per week, in contrast with the usual 10,000 they see per month outside of peak season. Intercom gives the tado° team peace of mind that customers won’t be left in a long ticket queue, or indefinitely on hold waiting to get through to the support team. Driving innovation with conversational insights
The ability to assign tags to customer conversations within the Intercom Inbox has enabled the support team to analyze and derive insights from the conversations they’re having on a day-to-day basis. Armed with these insights, the team can work closely with a dedicated team of energy systems engineers within tado°, whose primary focus is to improve the product by implementing customer feedback. Having this level of insight into customer pain points thanks to Intercom is empowering the team to drive innovation and product development forward as we continue to build towards a sustainable future. End-to-end engagement
Outside of using Intercom to support its customers, tado° leverages campaigns and Outbound Messages to nurture and engage customers throughout their lifecycle. As an NPS-driven company, the team uses Intercom to measure customer sentiment and continuously improve their customers’ experience. This ability to build and maintain strong, personal relationships with its customers is one of the many reasons tado° trusts Intercom."

They quickly realized that the platform needed custom development to meet their needs, so went in search of an out-of-the-box, user-friendly solution.

TagPlus streamlines its operations and powers support at scale with Intercom,"Challenge
As commercial management system TagPlus’ customer base expanded, it became harder for their support team to handle the increased chat volume. Their previous knowledge base didn't allow customers to self-serve efficiently, which resulted in a large number of support conversations being opened with the team.

GreenPal supports 300k customers and increased NPS by 60% with Intercom,"Challenge
As a growing company, lawn care services provider GreenPal knew how pivotal great customer support and customer feedback are in driving continuous improvement and business growth.

However, the speed of lead qualification was hampered by manual processes. Leads came in via contact forms, and sales teams responded via email – a workflow that didn’t allow ADRs to capture much data about leads or to engage them in conversations.
Envoy expanded its ADR team from two to four people, which required more effective tools for engaging prospects. Initially, the company chose a live chat solution for its website, but it wasn’t connected to other systems that help sales and support teams understand lead traffic and address customer concerns. Without a single place to track chats and create marketing campaigns, Envoy couldn’t gain visibility into the inbound lead funnel.
Armed with intelligence about leads
“We wanted a tool that could give us more intelligence about the leads coming to us, which would help us qualify them more quickly,” CathyLee says.
Envoy switched to Intercom to acquire leads faster. Now when their ADRs begin a live chat, they access data about the lead from Clearbit Enrichment – title, company details like employee count, industry and more – based on the prospect’s email address. Armed with this intelligence as soon as any chat starts, ADRs can segment leads based on Envoy’s qualification criteria.
For example, businesses with fewer than 50 employees fall into the self-service category. Those leads can be pushed to support, or are nurtured in marketing campaigns. ADRs can forward leads from larger companies to Envoy’s SMB or mid-market sales teams, depending on company size. Clearbit can also pull titles of prospects – another way to assure leads are high-quality. Leads with titles like “Director of Security” or “Facilities Manager” are in Envoy’s sweet spot.
“Right off the bat, ADRs can tell they’re talking to the right contact, even as they’re starting a conversation,” CathyLee says. ADRs can use Intercom Messages to introduce sales opportunities to the AEs, add notes to summarize conversations and link opportunities to Salesforce.
Envoy’s growing ADR team keeps up the pace with Intercom
“Intercom dramatically increased our volume of leads – and we saw another jump when we added auto messages,” CathyLee says. Leads generated by Intercom now make up 33% of Envoy’s leads. Their ADRs conduct about 1,200 monthly sales conversations through Intercom Messages.
As Envoy prepares to double the size of its ADR team, Intercom will help the company step up the pace for lead qualification. In addition to qualifying prospective customers over chat, Envoy also uses Intercom Messages. With 60 percent of its new leads coming from free trials, the company nurtures those leads through campaigns and offers the option to talk to a sales contact.
“One of the most valuable features of Intercom is that it gives your teams more at-bats,” CathyLee says. “And the more conversations you can start, the more opportunities your team has to qualify those leads.” Check out the rest of our stories"
How Housecall Pro leverages live chat & automation for growth,"To communicate with the tens of thousands of home service professionals using their platform, Housecall Pro relies on Intercom. By utilizing a combination of live chat and automation for sales and support, Housecall Pro has been able to scale their growth while maintaining a personal relationship with their customers.
When Roland Ligtenberg co-founded Housecall Pro one of his first priorities was to look for a solution to talk to his customers and learn more about them.
“Since the start, we’ve made it one of our core values to maintain a very close relationship with our customer, the Pro. The customer service standards our Pros typically receive in their industry is waiting on phone queues on hold or 24-48 hour email support ticket response times. We didn’t just want to offer something better, but 10x better, and implemented Intercom to deliver on that promise.”
As the company has grown in employees, customers, and revenue, Intercom has been there the whole way as the central solution for communicating with their customers. Now, Housecall Pro has a dedicated chat team of 8 people completing over 10,000 conversations a month!
“We use Intercom for support outreach with our customers and they have Intercom integrated into our app and web portal that they use to schedule jobs as well,” explains Angel Aspeytia, Manager of Tech Support at Housecall Pro. This is what makes Housecall Pro’s story unique. The platform enables thousands of mobile service businesses to schedule jobs, communicate with their customers, manage payments, online booking, reputation management and more, all while supporting them through “the blue chat bubble or BCB” as Intercom has become affectionately known by their customers.
“In the exclusive Facebook group that we have for our Pros, Intercom is known as the blue chat bubble and it’s where our customers know they can get the answers to their questions.” Scaling customer support with Intercom through automation
“We started out as a company that had the mission just to provide an easy way for our customers to chat with us, but then we figured out that we could do so much more than live chat and Intercom has played a role in facilitating that growth and sense of community,” Angel explains.
In the past twelve months, Housecall Pro has seen its chat volume almost double. “We thought a lot about whether or not we should start to offer phone support but the reason we stuck to Intercom is because we can handle so many customers at one time and asynchronously versus having to ask them to wait on hold for their turn,” says Angel.
As a SaaS platform, the efficiencies gained by leveraging Intercom allows Housecall Pro to pass down the cost savings and be the most competitively priced field service management app on the market.
The Housecall Pro team has also deployed Resolution Bot to help them tackle common queries as their conversation volume continues to grow and are now seeing around 15% of conversations being resolved by Resolution Bot.
Angel says “Resolution Bot has been really helpful in answering simple questions. It means we can answer the easy questions we get quickly before they even get to our teams so that we can focus on more complex questions that require more of our time.” Organically expanding use with live chat for sales
As Housecall Pro saw its chat volume increase, there was a natural increase in the number of people now using the messenger to enquire about buying a Housecall Pro subscription instead of just looking for support and so, the Chat Intercept team was born.
“As the volume of sales related chats increased, it only made sense to dedicate sales resources to these chats,” Alyssa Moretti, On-boarding Specialist at Housecall Pro explains.
The team’s goal is to shorten the sales cycle by using live chat as a channel to close deals quickly. Through Intercom, the support team is able to triage conversations, pass internal notes and assign sales-related conversations to the Chat Intercept team inbox swiftly.
In fact, as sales chat volume has grown, they’ve also implemented task bots to automatically triage support and sales conversations and pre-qualify leads. Now, a sales rep can jump right into the conversation with greater context into their industry, company size, and plan they are looking to purchase. With an average first response time of under five minutes, the team can quickly follow-up with leads that are ready to buy or set up a demo for prospects looking for a more traditional sales process. In most cases, the Chat Intercept team can close an enrollment (deal) within one hour when qualified leads proactively reach out to talk to sales.
By capitalizing on this low hanging fruit, the sales team is able to run a more efficient sales process and shorten the sales cycle for qualified leads. Right now, live chat as a channel represents about 10% of total enrollments a month for Housecall Pro. But the results speak for themselves:
On average, Housecall Pro has seen that deals driven through live chat close 27.5% faster compared to other channels. The lead to paid conversion rate for live chat is now 35% higher than any other marketing channel Housecall Pro is utilizing.
Customer satisfaction remains world-class even as volume grows
Housecall Pro prides itself on enabling its Pros to be able deliver an amazing customer experience for their customers and always aims to lead by example. One way they seek to do this is through a drive to improve customer engagement and really showcase the benefits of “the blue chat bubble”.
Since kicking off this initiative, Housecall Pro has maintained an overall happiness rating of above 90% for all conversations.
“We've noticed an increase in the amount of people who are actually willing to rate a conversation and now we have some team members who are regularly getting 100% rated conversations with an overall happiness rating of 91% on average but some are even higher at 96-99%,” Angel explains.
Through using Intercom, Housecall Pro has been able to remove reactive phone support and switch 100% to chat. As a result, they have been able to improve the customer experiences for both their customers and their customers’ customers and reallocate their team resources to continue fuelling their growth.
As head of growth, Roland sees Intercom as a pivotal platform in Housecall Pro’s toolbox, “We love leveraging new features Intercom continuously develops because it allows us to innovate and build automations to aid our exponential growth. The value it allows us to deliver to our Pros throughout their entire lifecycle is invaluable. Happy Pros provide us with the feedback that unlock unique product insights that gives us a massive competitive advantage on our mission to build the best platform for home service businesses.”"
How Keen scaled a personal support experience and increased user engagement,"To communicate with more than 50,000 developers that use their platform, Keen relies on Intercom. Tying together powerful features, efficiency at scale, and more personal communication, Intercom lets Keen make every interaction – from onboarding to support – a great experience.
“My job is to care about the developer. I constantly think about their experience on our platform and how we can improve it,” explains Maggie Jan, Director of Developer Advocacy at Keen. The fast growing technology company provides a platform for product owners and developers to build on data quickly and easily, enabling them to create in-app analytics and dashboards for their end users. The company has invested heavily in developing a world-class experience for customers. “It’s a developer-friendly product,” Maggie explains. “Our customers’ success depends on our ability to communicate clearly and on a personal level.”
Intercom was an ideal solution for Keen. The platform centralized all their customer communications, allowing them to reduce the time to resolution for support requests, and drive a 30% increase in customer satisfaction. These improvements to their customer experience reduced churn by 0.5%, and is helping them gain a competitive advantage as they build a reputation for friendly, helpful service.
Consolidating customer communication
Prior to Intercom, Keen used multiple tools for customer support and engagement. As the company grew, the siloed products made customer communication disorganized and inefficient. “We had Olark for live chat, emails coming in through Groove, but having them all separated was a mess. With Intercom, we can control everything from one place. Important user information is right along side of the conversation so we know exactly who our customers are, what they’re struggling with, and how we can help,” says Maggie.
With Intercom, Keen has connected their help desk and help center to work synchronously to tackle customer questions. The help center is the first stop for users to get support. It contains everything from technical help articles to product how-to guides, so users can find answers on their own. For issues they can’t handle themselves, users can easily reach out to Keen’s help desk via the Intercom Messenger. When it comes to supporting customer, the team inbox equips Keen with everything needed to solve a user’s problem. As new messages enter the inbox, teammates can see who’s working on a conversation to avoid overlap. In the conversation, a user’s profile and company data is displayed on the right-hand side, giving teammates key information to get to a solution faster. “From the inbox, I can go to the page the user is on and see exactly what they’re looking at, including their last query. I’m often able to make a quick adjustment to solve the problem,” says Adam Kahn, Support Engineer at Keen. Automation should complement support, not replace it. When a Keen user asks a question addressed by one of Keen’s help center articles, articles relevant to the conversation are automatically suggested to the teammate to share, or easily searchable in the message composer. Teammates also use macros that they can quickly personalize to answer frequently asked questions, address known product gaps, and assist in churn mitigation, in a fraction of the time. The efficiency of the team inbox, including macros, and help center articles has led to a dramatic 60% reduction in time to resolution for support conversations. Moreover, the team has cut down their time spent on support by 30%.
Letting user feedback shape the experience
For Keen, customer support is also their main channel for product feedback. They continuously engage customers to find out what their problems are and how to fix them. With Intercom, the Keen support team tags all feature requests and product questions and views them in aggregate so they can quickly prioritize their efforts.
Feedback through Intercom not only helps shape the product, but the customer experience as well. Maggie describes how users frequently asked about pricing and the upper limits of the APIs, even though the information was published on the website. “As a company, we really value transparency around pricing, but didn’t realize we were not doing a good job of making it clear and easy to find. The customer feedback we collected helped us figure out the best placement for that content. Customers are now better able to self-serve the information, and don’t frequently ask about it.” Targeted engagement boosts activation rate
Like many SaaS companies, Keen is always trying to improve the process of turning new signups into active users. After studying the behavior of new users, Keen saw the need to proactively highlight information at certain points in the onboarding process. To do so, they used Intercom to deliver automated in-app messages to reach users with the relevant product information at the right time. Easy access to customer support and improved product education in the onboarding flow have increased successful activation among new users. Maggie credits Intercom for “continued cost savings across customer experience,” and expects that, “using Intercom, we will be able to increase our activation rate by 10% this year.” Putting the customer first
In total, the improvements Keen has made with Intercom for support, product education, and engagement has improved customer satisfaction by 30%, driving real value for the business. Since consolidating all their customer support into Intercom, they’ve seen a remarkable 0.5%. decrease in churn. Maggie attributes Keen’s success to their customer-centric mentality. “We constantly ask ourselves, ‘What are we trying to provide for people who interact with our brand? How do we make the most of the relationship we have with our customers?’ Intercom gives us a way to act meaningfully on those challenges.”"
How Put.io proactively supports customers with Intercom,"Oftentimes, startups experience a single, cataclysmic event which catapults their number of new signups. For Put.io, a cloud-based BitTorent client based in Turkey, it was an unexpected article in TechCrunch.
Challenge
The team behind Put.io formed at the turn of the millennium, but the size of its community held slow and steady at around 150 users – all in its home country of Turkey – for years. As a result, the team’s support solution was a scrappy online forum where users could submit their own questions and answer others. It wasn’t a perfect solution, but it was the easiest way to manage lots of user queries, as well as announce new features. Co-founder Hasan Yalcinkaya was also wary of spamming his users.
Then in 2010, Put.io was covered unexpectedly in TechCrunch. Overnight, Put.io had 3,000 new signups. It was exciting and intimidating at the same time.
“To four introverted engineers whose first language isn’t English, this overnight spike was very overwhelming from a communications perspective,” Hasan recalls. “None of us had any marketing or customer-facing experience. Who were all these people? Where did they come from? What were they doing in our app? Should we say something to them?”
Solution
Put.io installed a free version of Intercom, which allowed it to immediately extract live data, such as a user’s last login, signup date, number of sessions, city and country, and much more.
“Being able to filter users by geography and behavior is great, but my biggest revelation was sorting users by the number of Twitter followers — we had some high rollers, by Internet standards!”
After getting a clear picture of users in their application, Put.io began using Intercom’s messaging features. Put.io installed Intercom’s in-app support widget so users could launch an in-app conversation without exiting the application. From Put.io’s perspective, it was easier to respond to customers thoughtfully and efficiently thanks to the additional context of live user data alongside each incoming message.
After doing this for a few weeks, things got more interesting. Put.io began proactively solving problems or warning customers of potential issues.
First, it grouped common support grievances that might be improved with the right information. Hasan’s team composed auto-messages targeting users before a problem arose. For example, one common issue customers faced was slow Internet speed, so Hasan sends this in-app message to active users. The thumbs up/thumbs down reply gives recipients a lightweight way to let Hasan know if the information was useful.
Another best practice Put.io began was to proactively warn users about issues. For instance, when one of its engineers accidentally reset some users’ activities, Hasan pushed the following in-app to affected users: A few responses were frustrated, but most people responded with something along the lines of “no problem – good luck!”
“It’s nice being able to announce problems through a private two-way conversation, rather than as a one-off message posted in a forum or through Twitter. Email-based confessions come too late or too early,” Hasan says.
More recently, Put.io has begun to use Intercom’s targeting capabilities to experiment with growth. One successful experiment it implemented recently was to offer a discount after six months. This in-app message is sent to users on their lowest-tier plan: This message prompted 20% of the recipients to upgrade immediately.
Results
Put.io has been using Intercom for about a year to listen and talk to its users, and according to Hasan, the dynamic has completely changed. Best of all, it’s led to a 14% reduction in churn. After replacing its support forum with Intercom, ""Suddenly, the tone of our customer conversations went from negative to productive."" “No matter what your company does — even if your audience is behind a computer screen 24/7 — personalized communications is the key to keeping users loyal,” says Hasan."
How Pantheon creates a unified customer experience across sales and support,"Pantheon is a website operations platform with a mission to power the open web as the primary platform for delivering digital experiences that drive results. It currently runs over 285,000 websites, enabling marketers and developers to quickly build, test, and manage Drupal & WordPress websites. CEO Zack Rosen knew they needed to create a seamless customer experience to match that of their platform.
With their previous ticketing setup, they were averaging responses in 30 minutes or less, but Zack knew they could improve that further by implementing live chat on their website. This was especially important because in the web publishing industry problems tend to happen right as developers are reaching crucial launch deadlines. Getting a quick solution to their problems during these times has an outsized impact on the success customers see with Pantheon which ultimately impacts retention.
Intercom brings Pantheon closer to its customers through live chat
Since switching to Intercom three years ago, 80% of inbound conversations come directly through the Messenger. With a global team of 25 agents providing 24/7 support coverage and fielding around 4,000 conversations a month, Intercom’s Inbox gives their team the necessary workflows to collaborate and quickly solve customer issues. Through live chat, Pantheon’s first response time has decreased to under 2 minutes!
For Shak Hossain, Pantheon’s Head of Support, Intercom’s data and reporting has given him the insights needed to scale their team’s growth appropriately to maximize team efficiency.
“Intercom gives us insights into busy and slow hours which help determine our staffing decisions. We can see week over week where our busiest hours are to finetune hours across our global team to ensure we have enough coverage at all times.” Crucially, Intercom’s conversation ratings have also enabled Shak to better understand how the support team is performing. When using a traditional ticketing system, the customer feedback response rate was less than 10% after a conversation was closed. Tickets simply weren’t getting rated because feedback was being asked in a follow-up email. With Intercom, feedback response rate has increased to over 40% of conversations that get a rating. Best of all, collecting more feedback has actually improved their CSAT scores from the low 90’s to high 90’s. As a result, Shak always has a pulse on how the support team is performing and ways in which they can improve the customer experience. All of this improvement has come even as their monthly conversation volume has grown. He attributes that primarily to the switch from ticketing to live chat.
“What chat gives us that ticketing doesn’t is we can develop an empathetic bond with our customers in real time. We believe strongly in a customer first philosophy, and live chat allows us to allay fears and develop trust that is harder to do asynchronously.”
As Sales adopts live chat, a consistent messaging experience becomes important
While the support team at Pantheon was fully ramped on live chat, the sales team was just starting to experiment with it. SDR manager Justin Campbell had implemented Olark as a simple way to provide an option to chat for leads that landed on their website. However by July of 2018, Justin noticed their chat volume begin to increase rapidly and they needed to find a more robust solution.
The key challenge was that 20-30% of chats they were fielding were actually support related. Even chats that initially started as a sales conversation could seamlessly transition into a support related question. The same issue was also experienced by the support team as well where a free trial user may have started a conversation to solve a technical question but then wanted to sign up for a paid plan.
When Justin’s SDR team encountered a technical support question they couldn’t answer, they would direct users to email their support alias to get their issue resolved. Using two different messengers was creating a fragmented customer experience and creating inefficiencies in the way sales and support collaborated.
“It was increasingly becoming clear that prospects were getting comfortable interacting through chat, even demanding it, which meant we needed to operationalize it in a better way. We needed to adopt one messenger across both our sales and support team in order to quickly triage inbound chats to the appropriate team and make it seamless for our prospects and customers too.”
Intercom’s Messenger now lives across Pantheon’s entire customer experience
By migrating all of their communication with prospects and customers to Intercom, Pantheon’s sales and support team can effortlessly collaborate to solve any customer questions. When inbound conversations come in, the support team can quickly triage conversations and assign it to the sales inbox when needed and vice versa. With notes, tags, and Intercom’s live view of customer data, both teams have the context they need to keep response times under two minutes. Most importantly, for the customer it’s one seamless experience. Even as the sales and support team work in the background, the customer only needs to start one conversation.
One particular aspect of Intercom that Justin values the most is the overall visibility of chats, including ones they have closed. He believes chat is useful as a training tool for ramping up new sales reps:
“When I’m onboarding new SDR’s to our team the first thing we do is put them on chat. It gives them good guardrails and enables them to craft more thoughtful answers, instead of a live call where they may be more nervous. We can also easily review their past conversations to provide feedback on areas for improvement.”
Since implementing Intercom in the SDR team, Pantheon has seen a 78% increase in the number of inbound leads converted via chat compared to their previous solution and 35% of chat sourced leads convert to enterprise opportunities.
Ultimately, for Zack crafting a seamless and consistent customer experience is a top company priority which is why he chose to use Intercom as Pantheon’s solution for customer messaging.
“Our first core value is customers come first. Strategically, we think a lot about how we can deliver on that. So when making a foundational platform decision like what solution we are going to use to communicate with our customers, we’re making a big bet. It’s not just about what the product does today, but the vision of where they are going. We chose Intercom because we know they are a product-centric company and have a similar customer-first mindset like us.”"
"How ThreadBeast drives conversions with personal, multi-channel support","ThreadBeast delivers a curated selection of menswear to thousands of subscribers every month. To communicate personally with each customer, ThreadBeast uses Intercom. Intercom integrates with the other channels and tools they use, like Facebook and Stripe, so they can provide personal, helpful support from one platform – increasing customer retention and improving conversions from Facebook advertising.
Support from day one
When ThreadBeast started out in 2015 they chose Intercom to handle all of their customer communication. “We were looking for something that really engages with our customers and provides a happy experience every single time,” says Blake Bolona, Head of Customer Experience.
Intercom’s “trifecta” of email, in-app messaging and live chat was key to the decision, Blake explains. “We were looking at other programs like MailChimp for email marketing, Zendesk for customer support, and Olark for live chat, but then we'd have three separate platforms. Intercom has everything, all in once place. It's a no-brainer.”
In two short years, ThreadBeast has gained 20,000 paying customers and continues to grow rapidly. Blake credits Intercom as a key part of their success: “It's had a huge impact on the business. When you find an easy way for customers to communicate with you, and an effortless way to prioritize and organize those communication channels, customers really appreciate that.” Blake manages 10 customer experience representatives who manage more than 40,000 customer conversations each month. They have a strict service-level agreement (SLA) of responding to every message, whichever channel it comes through, within 24 hours. With Intercom, they never have to worry about meeting the 24-hour deadline – they’ve kept their average response time down to just 4 hours. Making it easy for customers with Facebook support
Much of ThreadBeast’s growth comes from Facebook advertising, so the Facebook Messenger is a common channel for customers and prospects to contact them. To manage these conversations from the same place as their other customer communication, they began using Intercom’s Facebook integration.
“Facebook is a big part of our marketing strategy, so people will often message us from our Facebook page,” explains Blake. “They typically ask questions about our service, how much we cost, and how to sign up. With Intercom, we can convert them directly over live chat. That's really big for our business.” The integration means the team can offer multiple channels of communication for their customers and manage them from one inbox. “The ease of having messages filter directly into our Intercom inbox means we don't have to worry about checking Facebook - it makes it much simpler and extremely efficient for the team,” says Blake. The increased efficiency and ease-of-use has helped ThreadBeast ensure they’re responding to 100% of Facebook messages, up from 75% before they started using the integration.
Providing such personal, helpful support also results in “astounding” brand loyalty among ThreadBeast’s customers: “ A lot of customers will answer questions for us and advocate on our behalf on our Facebook advertisements, which is amazing to witness.”
Providing better support with context
In addition to Facebook, ThreadBeast also uses Intercom’s Stripe integration so they can see a customer's account whilst they’re chatting with them. This significantly reduces the time needed to help customers with billing and account questions.
“Having the ability to push data through integrations has definitely helped us use Intercom as our CRM,” Blake says. ""We have an internal database, but we try to keep most of our information and all customer communication within Intercom whenever possible.” This information, along with Intercom’s automated conversation assignment rules and tagging features, helps the team prioritize and route messages to different inboxes depending on the request.
“We can see when we're speaking with members that have subscribed with us versus prospective members that ask about our service and haven't subscribed yet. We can see the subscription plan they're on, the date they signed up, and the last time they reached out to us. Rather than having to look up their account in Stripe and going through a separate platform, we can see everything within Intercom. It saves significant time, and helps scale our customer support efficiently.”
A personal touch
Intercom also helped ThreadBeast hit the right tone when talking to customers; initially, they kept support messages very formal, but found this wasn't resonating with customers. “I've discovered that being B2C and because of our marketing demographics, having less formal and more personable conversations hold exceptional value,"" says Blake. Now, everyone on the team uses their own unique, personal communication style: “Sometimes our customers will request to talk with a customer experience representative by name - it doesn’t really get more personal than that.”"
Baremetrics increases annual billing by 30% using targeted messages,"Intercom has been Baremetrics' platform for customer communication from day one, giving them insight into customers’ in-app activity, and the ability to reach them across multiple channels. With Intercom, they can send the right message in the right context, letting them build stronger relationships and increase the value of each customer.
A better way to encourage annual billing
The CEO of Baremetrics, Josh Pigford, is always looking for better ways to run his business. From hiring to product announcements, he relentlessly tests and refines every aspect of his business for optimal performance. Recently, Josh turned his attention toward customer billing. As a SaaS company, Baremetrics offers customers both monthly and annual billing options. Annual billing is preferred by Baremetrics, as it increases the predictability of revenue, reduces churn, and improves cash flow. Given these benefits, Josh wanted to find a more effective way to encourage customers to switch to annual billing than what he typically saw from other SaaS businesses.
“What we see a lot of companies do is a once-a-year email push in the fourth quarter to try and squeeze out a single influx of cash. We took this a step further and started sending out emails within a few months of a company signing up,” explains Josh.
The first step was to determine when customers would be more open to switch. Specifically, the time when newly-engaged customers grasped the long-term value of the product and no longer need the flexibility of monthly billing to opt out. Using Intercom, the Baremetrics team sent an email targeting users who had logged in more than 10 times in the first 30 days after signing up. To further incentivize these customers to switch, they offered three months of service free, instead of the usual two. The results were good, the email had an 11% conversion rate, allowing Baremetrics to bill over $14,000 in additional revenue during the following week. But Josh wanted to go a step further to increase the response and conversion rate of the message.
The power of in-app messaging
By using Intercom, Baremetrics found that in-app messages are often the best way to reach customers – outperforming email in response rate and quality of the response.
Josh decided that given the potential impact on revenue, it was worth sending the same offer to the same audience via an in-app message. The simple act of delivering the message in a different context made a big impact – converting an additional 14% of customers. In total, Josh was able to increase annual plan subscriptions by 30%.
Josh attributes this success to the power of reaching customers in the right context. “With an in-app message, the annual offer is presented right smack in the middle of the user soaking up the value they get from Baremetrics.”
Unlike email, in-app messages don’t compete with other messages vying for your customer’s attention. They view your message when they are engaged and exclusively focused on your product – making it much more likely they will respond.
""When communicating with customers, email and in-app are not equal. Context matters."" Building a superior messaging strategy
The annual pricing message is one of more than 100 auto messages Baremetrics has created to improve the customer experience and their business. But their success isn’t due to the quantity of messages – it’s the quality. Josh explains, “the goal is not to message everyone. I think a lot of companies make the mistake of assuming their entire customer base needs to know something. That’s the wrong approach because your customers will tire of hearing from you.”
Baremetrics is careful to send only relevant messages. They gather customer feedback to help curate and optimize the content they send, create targeted messages to address frequently asked questions, and add informative content relating to their customers’ business problems.
An example of this strategy is on the customer’s churn dashboard. Josh explains that, “if one of our customers is on a churn page and their churn rate is above 15%, then we show an in-app message with a video from me, a few articles to help them decrease their churn rate, and invite them to shoot me a reply to see if I can help. So instead of having them ask us how to do something, we proactively show them. And now the messages we receive on those metric pages are more like ‘Thanks for sending over that information, it was a huge help’.” The benefits of continuously onboarding
The ability to automatically deliver in-app messages throughout the customer lifecycle lets Baremetrics approach customer onboarding in a new way. “Often times you think of onboarding in the context of a new signup, but we look at onboarding as a continuous process for our customers. Whether its feature awareness or solution awareness, or helping customers find solutions to problems inside Baremetrics. The onboarding process doesn’t really stop for us,” says Josh.
Instead of overwhelming users by trying to convey all the features and functionality of the product when they sign up, Baremetrics progressively onboards and educates them based on their behavior. Users can now start using the platform faster, learn more about the features that matter to them, and avoid having read through dense onboarding material right when they sign up.
Looking ahead, Baremetrics wants to continue to build out in-app messages that enable their users to get the most out of the platform. By tracking customer feature usage and then piping that data into Intercom, they create a more complete picture of their customers so they can better serve their needs and find new ways to improve the customer experience.
""With Intercom we get the insights we need to constantly improve the customer experience. We can make fewer assumptions about our customers and message them at the best possible moment."""
